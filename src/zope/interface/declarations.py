"""Implementation of interface declarations

There are three flavors of declarations:

  - Declarations are used to simply name declared interfaces.

  - ImplementsDeclarations are used to express the interfaces that a
    class implements (that instances of the class provides).

    Implements specifications support inheriting interfaces.

  - ProvidesDeclarations are used to express interfaces directly
    provided by objects.

        >>> int(IC in providedBy(ob))
        1

      The object, ``ob`` provides ``I1``, ``I2``, and whatever interfaces
      instances have been declared for instances of ``C``.

      To remove directly provided interfaces, use ``directlyProvidedBy`` and
      subtract the unwanted interfaces. For example::

        >>> directlyProvides(ob, directlyProvidedBy(ob)-I2)
        >>> int(I1 in providedBy(ob))
        1
        >>> int(I2 in providedBy(ob))
        0

      removes I2 from the interfaces directly provided by
      ``ob``. The object, ``ob`` no longer directly provides ``I2``,
      although it might still provide ``I2`` if it's class
      implements ``I2``.

      To add directly provided interfaces, use ``directlyProvidedBy`` and
      include additional interfaces.  For example::

        >>> int(I2 in providedBy(ob))
        0
        >>> directlyProvides(ob, directlyProvidedBy(ob), I2)

      adds I2 to the interfaces directly provided by ob::
