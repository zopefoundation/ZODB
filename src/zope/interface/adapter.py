"""Adapter-style interface registry

This implementation is based on a notion of "surrogate" interfaces.

$Id$
"""

# Implementation notes

# We keep a collection of surrogates.

# A surrogate is a surrogate for a specification (interface or
# declaration).  We use weak references in order to remove surrogates
# if the corresponding specification goes away.

# Each surrogate keeps track of:

# - The adapters registered directly for that surrogate, and

# - The "implied" adapters, which is the adapters that can be computed
#   from instances of that surrogate.

# The later data structure takes into account adapters registered for
# specifications that the registered surrogate extends.

# The registrations are of the form:

#   {(subscription, with, name, specification) -> factories}

# where:

#   'subscription' is a flag indicating if this registration is for
#   subscription adapters.

#   'with' is a tuple of specs that is non-empty only in the case
#   of multi-adapters.  

#   'name' is a unicode adapter name.  Unnamed adapters have an empty
#   name.

#   'specification' is the interface being adapted to.

#   'factories' is normally a tuple of factories, but can be anything.
#   (See the "raw" option to the query-adapter calls.)  For subscription
#   adapters, it is a tuple of tuples of factories.

# The implied adapters are held in a single dictionary. The items in the
# dictionary are of several forms:

# For single adapters:
#
# {specification -> {name -> object}
#
# where object is usually a sequence of factories

# For multiple adapters:
#
# {(specification, order) -> {name -> {with -> object}}}

# For single subscription adapters:
#
# {('s', specification) -> tuple([object])}

# For multiple-subscription adapters:
#
# {('s', specification, order) -> {with -> tuple([object])}}
