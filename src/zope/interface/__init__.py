"""Interfaces

This package implements the Python "scarecrow" proposal.

The package exports two objects, `Interface` and `Attribute` directly. It also
exports several helper methods. Interface is used to create an interface with
a class statement, as in:

  class IMyInterface(Interface):
    '''Interface documentation
    '''

    def meth(arg1, arg2):
        '''Documentation for meth
        '''

    # Note that there is no self argument

To find out what you can do with interfaces, see the interface
interface, `IInterface` in the `interfaces` module.

The package has several public modules:

  o `declarations` provides utilities to declare interfaces on objects. It
    also provides a wide range of helpful utilities that aid in managing
    declared interfaces. Most of its public names are however imported here. 

  o `document` has a utility for documenting an interface as structured text.

  o `exceptions` has the interface-defined exceptions

  o `interfaces` contains a list of all public interfaces for this package.

  o `verify` has utilities for verifying implementations of interfaces.

See the module doc strings for more information.
