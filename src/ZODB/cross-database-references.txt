Cross-Database References
=========================

Persistent references to objects in different databases within a
multi-database are allowed.

Lets set up a multi-database with 2 databases:

    >>> import ZODB.tests.util, transaction, persistent
    >>> databases = {}
    >>> db1 = ZODB.tests.util.DB(databases=databases, database_name='1')
    >>> db2 = ZODB.tests.util.DB(databases=databases, database_name='2')

And create a persistent object in the first database:

    >>> tm = transaction.TransactionManager()
    >>> conn1 = db1.open(transaction_manager=tm)
    >>> p1 = MyClass()
    >>> conn1.root()['p'] = p1
    >>> tm.commit()

First, we get a connection to the second database.  We get the second
connection using the first connection's `get_connection` method.  This
is important.  When using multiple databases, we need to make sure we
use a consistent set of connections so that the objects in the
connection caches are connected in a consistent manner.

    >>> conn2 = conn1.get_connection('2')

Now, we'll create a second persistent object in the second database.
We'll have a reference to the first object:

    >>> p2 = MyClass()
    >>> conn2.root()['p'] = p2
    >>> p2.p1 = p1
    >>> tm.commit()

Now, let's open a separate connection to database 2.  We use it to
read `p2`, use `p2` to get to `p1`, and verify that it is in database 1:

    >>> conn = db2.open()
    >>> p2x = conn.root()['p']
    >>> p1x = p2x.p1

    >>> p2x is p2, p2x._p_oid == p2._p_oid, p2x._p_jar.db() is db2
    (False, True, True)

    >>> p1x is p1, p1x._p_oid == p1._p_oid, p1x._p_jar.db() is db1
    (False, True, True)

It isn't valid to create references outside a multi database:

    >>> db3 = ZODB.tests.util.DB()
    >>> conn3 = db3.open(transaction_manager=tm)
    >>> p3 = MyClass()
    >>> conn3.root()['p'] = p3
    >>> tm.commit()

    >>> p2.p3 = p3
    >>> tm.commit() # doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    InvalidObjectReference:
    Attempt to store an object from a foreign database connection

    >>> tm.abort()

Databases for new objects
-------------------------

Objects are normally added to a database by making them reachable from
an object already in the database.  This is unambiguous when there is
only one database.  With multiple databases, it is not so clear what
happens.  Consider:

    >>> p4 = MyClass()
    >>> p1.p4 = p4
    >>> p2.p4 = p4

In this example, the new object is reachable from both `p1` in database
1 and `p2` in database 2.  If we commit, which database should `p4` end up
in?  This sort of ambiguity could lead to subtle bugs.  For that reason,
an error is generated if we commit changes when new objects are
reachable from multiple databases:

    >>> tm.commit() # doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    InvalidObjectReference: A new object is reachable from multiple
    databases. Won't try to guess which one was correct!

    >>> tm.abort()

To resolve this ambiguity, we can commit before an object becomes
reachable from multiple databases.

    >>> p4 = MyClass()
    >>> p1.p4 = p4
    >>> tm.commit()
    >>> p2.p4 = p4
    >>> tm.commit()
    >>> p4._p_jar.db().database_name
    '1'

This doesn't work with a savepoint:

    >>> p5 = MyClass()
    >>> p1.p5 = p5
    >>> s = tm.savepoint()
    >>> p2.p5 = p5
    >>> tm.commit() # doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    InvalidObjectReference: A new object is reachable from multiple
    databases. Won't try to guess which one was correct!

    >>> tm.abort()

(Maybe it should.)

We can disambiguate this situation by using the connection add method
to explicitly say what database an object belongs to:

    >>> p5 = MyClass()
    >>> p1.p5 = p5
    >>> p2.p5 = p5
    >>> conn1.add(p5)
    >>> tm.commit()
    >>> p5._p_jar.db().database_name
    '1'

This the most explicit and thus the best way, when practical, to avoid
the ambiguity.

Cross-database reference seat belt
----------------------------------

Some applications create unintentional cross-database references when
they move objects between containers stored in ZODB. For example, an
object might be created in a session container located in a volatile
database, then later moved (rather than copied) to the main database.
In that case, the reference will break when the session expires or the
server restarts.

ZODB provides an optional seat belt that prevents unintentional
cross-database references. The seat belt is disabled by default, but
can be enabled by passing "check_xrefs=True" to the DB constructor.

When the seat belt is enabled, every cross-database reference is
checked by the _p_check_xref method of the persistent object holding
the reference; objects that do not have a _p_check_xref method are
not allowed to hold any cross-database references.

Lets set up a multi-database with 2 databases, this time checking
cross-database references from `main_db` but not from `session_db`:

    >>> import ZODB.tests.util, transaction, persistent
    >>> databases = {}
    >>> main_db = ZODB.tests.util.DB(databases=databases, database_name='main',
    ...     check_xrefs=True)
    >>> session_db = ZODB.tests.util.DB(databases=databases,
    ...     database_name='sessions')

Create a persistent object in both databases:

    >>> tm = transaction.TransactionManager()
    >>> main_conn = main_db.open(transaction_manager=tm)
    >>> main_obj = MyClass()
    >>> main_conn.root()['p'] = main_obj
    >>> session_conn = main_conn.get_connection('sessions')
    >>> session_obj = MyClass()
    >>> session_conn.root()['p'] = session_obj
    >>> tm.commit()

Try to create a reference from `main_obj` to `session_obj`, which is not
allowed because the seat belt is enabled in `main_db` and `main_obj` has
no _p_check_xref method:

    >>> main_obj.someattr = session_obj
    >>> tm.commit() # doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    InvalidObjectReference: Attempt to store a cross database reference
    from an object that does not have a _p_check_xref method
    >>> tm.abort()
    >>> hasattr(main_obj, 'someattr')
    False

A reference from `session_obj` to `main_obj` is allowed, however, because
the seat belt is disabled in session_db.

    >>> session_obj.someattr = main_obj
    >>> tm.commit()
    >>> hasattr(session_obj, 'someattr')
    True

Create an object that has a _p_check_xref method.  Allow the object to
refer to session_obj.

    >>> main_obj = MyClass_w__p_check_xref()
    >>> main_conn.root()['p'] = main_obj
    >>> main_obj.allowed_xrefs = [session_obj]
    >>> main_obj.someattr = session_obj
    >>> tm.commit()

The _p_check_xref method can disallow a reference.

    >>> main_obj.allowed_xrefs = ()
    >>> tm.commit() # doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    InvalidObjectReference: A cross database reference was disallowed
    by a _p_check_xref method
    >>> tm.abort()

Verify the right _p_check_xref method is called:

    >>> main_obj.second = MyClass_w__p_check_xref()
    >>> main_obj.second.allowed_xrefs = [session_obj]
    >>> main_obj.second.someattr = session_obj
    >>> tm.commit()

NOTE
----

This implementation is incomplete.  It allows creating and using
cross-database references, however, there are a number of facilities
missing:

cross-database garbage collection

    Garbage collection is done on a database by database basis.
    If an object on a database only has references to it from other
    databases, then the object will be garbage collected when its
    database is packed.  The cross-database references to it will be
    broken.

cross-database undo

    Undo is only applied to a single database.  Fixing this for
    multiple databases is going to be extremely difficult.  Undo
    currently poses consistency problems, so it is not (or should not
    be) widely used.

Cross-database aware (tolerant) export/import

    The export/import facility needs to be aware, at least, of cross-database
    references.
