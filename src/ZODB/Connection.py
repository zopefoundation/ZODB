class Connection(ExportImport, object):
    """Connection to ZODB for loading and storing objects.

    The Connection object serves as a data manager.  The root() method
    on a Connection returns the root object for the database.  This
    object and all objects reachable from it are associated with the
    Connection that loaded them.  When a transaction commits, it uses
    the Connection to store modified objects.

    Typical use of ZODB is for each thread to have its own
    Connection and that no thread should have more than one Connection
    to the same database.  A thread is associated with a Connection by
    loading objects from that Connection.  Objects loaded by one
    thread should not be used by another thread.

    A Connection can be associated with a single version when it is
    created.  By default, a Connection is not associated with a
    version; it uses non-version data.

    Each Connection provides an isolated, consistent view of the
    database, by managing independent copies of objects in the
    database.  At transaction boundaries, these copies are updated to
    reflect the current state of the database.

    You should not instantiate this class directly; instead call the
    open() method of a DB instance.

    In many applications, root() is the only method of the Connection
    that you will need to use.

    Synchronization
    ---------------

    A Connection instance is not thread-safe.  It is designed to
    support a thread model where each thread has its own transaction.
    If an application has more than one thread that uses the
    connection or the transaction the connection is registered with,
    the application should provide locking.

    The Connection manages movement of objects in and out of object
    storage.

    XXX We should document an intended API for using a Connection via
    multiple threads.

    XXX We should explain that the Connection has a cache and that
    multiple calls to get() will return a reference to the same
    object, provided that one of the earlier objects is still
    referenced.  Object identity is preserved within a connection, but
    not across connections.

    XXX Mention the database pool.

    A database connection always presents a consistent view of the
    objects in the database, although it may not always present the
    most current revision of any particular object.  Modifications
    made by concurrent transactions are not visible until the next
    transaction boundary (abort or commit).

    Two options affect consistency.  By default, the mvcc and synch
    options are enabled by default.

    If you pass mvcc=True to db.open(), the Connection will never read
    non-current revisions of an object.  Instead it will raise a
    ReadConflictError to indicate that the current revision is
    unavailable because it was written after the current transaction
    began.

    The logic for handling modifications assumes that the thread that
    opened a Connection (called db.open()) is the thread that will use
    the Connection.  If this is not true, you should pass synch=False
    to db.open().  When the synch option is disabled, some transaction
    boundaries will be missed by the Connection; in particular, if a
    transaction does not involve any modifications to objects loaded
    from the Connection and synch is disabled, the Connection will
    miss the transaction boundary.  Two examples of this behavior are
    db.undo() and read-only transactions.
