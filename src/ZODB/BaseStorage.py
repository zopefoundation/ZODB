    """Abstract base class that supports storage implementations.

    A subclass must define the following methods:
    load()
    close()
    cleanup()
    lastSerial()
    lastTransaction()

    It must override these hooks:
    _begin()
    _vote()
    _abort()
    _finish()
    _clear_temp()

    If it stores multiple revisions, it should implement
    loadSerial()
    loadBefore()
    iterator()

    If the subclass wants to implement undo, it should implement the
    multiple revision methods and:
    loadSerial()
    undo()
    undoInfo()
    undoLog()

    If the subclass wants to implement versions, it must implement:
    abortVersion()
    commitVersion()
    modifiedInVersion()
    versionEmpty()
    versions()

    Each storage will have two locks that are accessed via lock
    acquire and release methods bound to the instance.  (Yuck.)
    _lock_acquire / _lock_release (reentrant)
    _commit_lock_acquire / _commit_lock_release

    The commit lock is acquired in tpc_begin() and released in
    tpc_abort() and tpc_finish().  It is never acquired with the other
    lock held.

    The other lock appears to protect _oid and _transaction and
    perhaps other things.  It is always held when load() is called, so
    presumably the load() implementation should also acquire the lock.
