Todo for preview
----------------

Must
----

- Merge to current ZODB trunk

- Test for possible collision of the dirty blob filename when two concurring
  transactions try to update an existing blob. 

- Test BlobStorage.getSize

- Test conflict behavior.

- Ensure we detect and play a failed txn involving blobs forward or backward
  at startup.

Production
----------

- Make the ClientStorage support minimizing the blob cache. (Idea: LRU
  principle via mstat access time and a size-based threshold) currently).

- ZConfig config testing (make sure that blob storage config via ZConfig does
  the right thing)

- More ZEO tests.

- Importing backward compatible ZEXP files (no \0BLOBSTART) used

- Test Connection.TmpStore.storeBlob better.  Why doesn't it do any
  locking like normal storages do?  It also needs to clean up its
  tempfiles.

- abort is never called on a BlobStorage when a transaction is
  aborted... it couldn't have been because there was basically a bit
  of nonsensical code in the method that would have raised an
  exception.  I don't think we solved this.  I think we did figure out
  why it wasn't called -- it seems that methods of a
  zope.proxy-wrapped object aren't rebound to the wrapper but instead
  to the wrapped object.  I then tried every which way to have some
  cleanup code invoked on abort (overriding "tpc_abort" instead of
  "_abort", overriding "abort" instead of "_abort") but without
  success.  Late in the day I think we figured that the abort cleanup
  code might need to go in the "BlobDataManager" (each blob has its
  own data manager) instead of the BlobStorage because it's unclear
  when BlobStorage's tpc_abort/_abort/abort methods will be called.

- Savepoints: currently non-optimistic savepoints in transactions
  which involve blobs don't work.  Is this OK?

Far future
----------

- More options for blob directory structures (e.g. dirstorage's
  bushy/chunky/lawn/flat).

- Allow "read-only" blob cache dirs from ClientStorages which can point to a
  filesystem mount from the ZEO server of the canonical blob locations.

- Test shared client usage of blob storage dir from ZEO server
