Todo for preview
----------------

Must
----

- Merge to current ZODB trunk

- Unify ZEO/Blob implementation and the BlobProxyStorage directory structures.

- Test for possible collision of the dirty blob filename when two concurring
  transactions try to update an existing blob. 

- Test BlobStorage.getSize

- Test conflict behavior.

- Ensure we detect and play a failed txn involving blobs forward or backward
  at startup.

Production
----------

- Log loudly on best_rename when it actually does a copy.

- Make the ClientStorage support minimizing the blob cache. (Idea: LRU
  principle via mstat access time and a size-based threshold) currently).

- ZConfig config testing (make sure that blob storage config via ZConfig does
  the right thing)

- More ZEO tests.

- Importing backward compatible ZEXP files (no \0BLOBSTART) used

Far future
----------

- More options for blob directory structures (e.g. dirstorage's
  bushy/chunky/lawn/flat).

- Allow "read-only" blob cache dirs from ClientStorages which can point to a
  filesystem mount from the ZEO server of the canonical blob locations.

- Test shared client usage of blob storage dir from ZEO server
