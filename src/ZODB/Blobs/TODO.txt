Tests
-----

- ZConfig config testing (make sure that blob storage
  config via ZConfig does the right thing)

- Test BlobStorage.getSize

- Test conflict behavior.

- Test shared client usage of blob cache dir.

- More ZEO tests.

Features
--------

- Ensure we detect and play a failed txn involving blobs forward or
  backward at startup.

- Importing backward compatible ZEXP files (no \0BLOBSTART) used

- More options for blob directory structures (e.g. dirstorage's
  bushy/chunky/lawn/flat).

- Log loudly on best_rename when it actually does a
  copy.

- Unify ZEO/Blob implementation and the BlobProxyStorage directory
  structures.

- Write code to clean up ClientStorage blob cache (it will grow without
  bound currently).

- Allow "read-only" blob cache dirs from ClientStorages which can
  point to a filesystem mount from the ZEO server of the canonical
  blob locations.
