  config via ZConfig does the right thing)

Features
--------

- Ensure we detect and play a failed txn involving blobs forward or
  backward at startup.

- Importing backward compatible ZEXP files (no \0BLOBSTART) used

- More options for blob directory structures (e.g. dirstorage's
  bushy/chunky/lawn/flat).

- Log loudly on best_rename when it actually does a
  copy.

- Unify ZEO/Blob implementation and the BlobProxyStorage directory
  structures.
