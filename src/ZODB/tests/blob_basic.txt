ZODB Blob support
=================

You create a blob like this::

    >>> from ZODB.blob import Blob
    >>> myblob = Blob()

A blob implements the IBlob interface::

    >>> from ZODB.interfaces import IBlob
    >>> IBlob.providedBy(myblob)
    True

We can open a new blob file for reading, but it won't have any data::

    >>> with myblob.open("r") as fp: fp.read()
    b''

But we can write data to a new Blob by opening it for writing::

    >>> f = myblob.open("w")
    >>> _ = f.write(b"Hi, Blob!")

If we try to open a Blob again while it is open for writing, we get an error::

    >>> myblob.open("r")
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
    ZODB.interfaces.BlobError: Already opened for writing.

We can close the file::

    >>> f.close()

Now we can open it for reading::

    >>> f2 = myblob.open("r")

And we get the data back::

    >>> f2.read()
    b'Hi, Blob!'

If we want to, we can open it again::

    >>> f3 = myblob.open("r")
    >>> f3.read()
    b'Hi, Blob!'

But we can't open it for writing, while it is opened for reading::

    >>> myblob.open("a")
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
    ZODB.interfaces.BlobError: Already opened for reading.

Before we can write, we have to close the readers::

    >>> f2.close()
    >>> f3.close()

Now we can open it for writing again and e.g. append data::

    >>> f4 = myblob.open("a")
    >>> _ = f4.write(b"\nBlob is fine.")

We can't open a blob while it is open for writing:

    >>> myblob.open("w")
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    ZODB.interfaces.BlobError: Already opened for writing.

    >>> myblob.open("r")
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    ZODB.interfaces.BlobError: Already opened for writing.

    >>> f4.close()

Now we can read it::

    >>> f4a = myblob.open("r")
    >>> f4a.read()
    b'Hi, Blob!\nBlob is fine.'
    >>> f4a.close()

You shouldn't need to explicitly close a blob unless you hold a reference
to it via a name.  If the first line in the following test kept a reference
around via a name, the second call to open it in a writable mode would fail
with a BlobError, but it doesn't::

    >>> with myblob.open("r+") as fp: fp.read()
    b'Hi, Blob!\nBlob is fine.'
    >>> f4b = myblob.open("a")
    >>> f4b.close()

We can read lines out of the blob too::

    >>> f5 = myblob.open("r")
    >>> f5.readline()
    b'Hi, Blob!\n'
    >>> f5.readline()
    b'Blob is fine.'
    >>> f5.close()

We can seek to certain positions in a blob and read portions of it::

    >>> f6 = myblob.open('r')
    >>> _ = f6.seek(4)
    >>> int(f6.tell())
    4
    >>> f6.read(5)
    b'Blob!'
    >>> f6.close()

We can use the object returned by a blob open call as an iterable::

    >>> f7 = myblob.open('r')
    >>> for line in f7:
    ...     print(line.decode())
    Hi, Blob!
    <BLANKLINE>
    Blob is fine.
    >>> f7.close()

We can truncate a blob::

    >>> f8 = myblob.open('a')
    >>> _ = f8.truncate(0)
    >>> f8.close()
    >>> f8 = myblob.open('r')
    >>> f8.read()
    b''
    >>> f8.close()

Blobs are always opened in binary mode::

    >>> f9 = myblob.open("r")
    >>> f9.mode
    'rb'
    >>> f9.close()

Blobs that have not been committed can be opened using any mode,
except for "c"::

    >>> from ZODB.blob import BlobError, valid_modes
    >>> for mode in valid_modes:
    ...     try:
    ...         f10 = Blob().open(mode)
    ...     except BlobError:
    ...         print('open failed with mode "%s"' % mode)
    ...     else:
    ...         f10.close()
    open failed with mode "c"

Some cleanup in this test is needed::

    >>> import transaction
    >>> transaction.get().abort()

Subclassing Blobs
-----------------

Blobs are not subclassable::

    >>> class SubBlob(Blob):
    ...     pass
    >>> my_sub_blob = SubBlob()
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
    TypeError: Blobs do not support subclassing.

Passing data to the blob constructor
------------------------------------

If you have a small amount of data, you can pass it to the blob
constructor.  (This is a convenience, mostly for writing tests.)

    >>> myblob = Blob(b'some data')
    >>> with myblob.open() as fp: fp.read()
    b'some data'
