def testAddingThenModifyThenAbort():

We ran into a problem in which abort failed after adding an object in
a savepoint and then modifying the object.  The problem was that, on
commit, the savepoint was aborted before the modifications were
aborted.  Because the object was added in the savepoint, its _p_oid
and _p_jar were cleared when the savepoint was aborted.  The object
was in the registered-object list.  There's an invariant for this
list that states that all objects in the list should have an oid and
(correct) jar.

The fix was to abort work done after the savepoint before aborting the
savepoint.

We got conflict errors when we committed after we modified an object

The problem was that we were effectively commiting the object twice --
when commiting the current data and when committing the savepoint.
The fix was to first make a new savepoint to move new changes to the
savepoint storage and *then* to commit the savepoint storage.

def testSavepointDoesCacheGC():
    """\
Although the interface doesn't guarantee this internal detail, making a
savepoint should do incremental gc on connection memory caches.  Indeed,
one traditional use for savepoints is simply to free memory space midstream
during a long transaction.  Before ZODB 3.4.2, making a savepoint failed
to trigger cache gc, and this test verifies that it now does.

    >>> import gc
    >>> import ZODB
    >>> from ZODB.tests.MinPO import MinPO
    >>> from ZODB.MappingStorage import MappingStorage
    >>> import transaction
    >>> CACHESIZE = 5  # something tiny
    >>> LOOPCOUNT = CACHESIZE * 10
    >>> st = MappingStorage("Test")
    >>> db = ZODB.DB(st, cache_size=CACHESIZE)
    >>> cn = db.open()
    >>> rt = cn.root()

Now attach substantially more than CACHESIZE persistent objects to the root:

    >>> for i in range(LOOPCOUNT):
    ...     rt[i] = MinPO(i)
    >>> transaction.commit()

Now modify all of them; the cache should contain LOOPCOUNT MinPO objects
then, + 1 for the root object:

    >>> for i in range(LOOPCOUNT):
    ...     obj = rt[i]
    ...     obj.value = -i
    >>> len(cn._cache) == LOOPCOUNT + 1
    True

Making a savepoint at this time used to leave the cache holding the same
number of objects. Make sure the cache shrinks now instead. (Implementations that use
weak references, such as PyPy, may need a garbage collection.)

    >>> dummy = transaction.savepoint()
    >>> _ = gc.collect()
    >>> len(cn._cache) <= CACHESIZE + 1
    True

Verify all the values are as expected:

    >>> failures = []
    >>> for i in range(LOOPCOUNT):
    ...     obj = rt[i]
    ...     if obj.value != -i:
    ...         failures.append(obj)
