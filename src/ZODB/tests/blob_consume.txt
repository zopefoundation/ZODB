Consuming existing files
========================

The ZODB Blob implementation allows to import existing files as Blobs within
an O(1) operation we call `consume`::

Let's create a file::

    >>> to_import = open('to_import', 'wb')
    >>> _ = to_import.write(b"I'm a Blob and I feel fine.")

The file *must* be closed before giving it to consumeFile:

    >>> to_import.close()

Now, let's consume this file in a blob by specifying it's name::

    >>> from ZODB.blob import Blob
    >>> blob = Blob()
    >>> blob.consumeFile('to_import')

After the consumeFile operation, the original file has been removed:

    >>> import os
    >>> os.path.exists('to_import')
    False

We now can call open on the blob and read and write the data::

    >>> blob_read = blob.open('r')
    >>> blob_read.read()
    b"I'm a Blob and I feel fine."
    >>> blob_read.close()
    >>> blob_write = blob.open('w')
    >>> _ = blob_write.write(b'I was changed.')
    >>> blob_write.close()

We can not consume a file when there is a reader or writer around for a blob
already::

    >>> with open('to_import', 'wb') as file:
    ...     _ = file.write(b'I am another blob.')
    >>> blob_read = blob.open('r')
    >>> blob.consumeFile('to_import')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ZODB.interfaces.BlobError: Already opened for reading.
    >>> blob_read.close()
    >>> blob_write = blob.open('w')
    >>> blob.consumeFile('to_import')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ZODB.interfaces.BlobError: Already opened for writing.
    >>> blob_write.close()

Now, after closing all readers and writers we can consume files again::

    >>> blob.consumeFile('to_import')
    >>> blob_read = blob.open('r')
    >>> blob_read.read()
    b'I am another blob.'

    >>> blob_read.close()

Edge cases
==========

There are some edge cases what happens when the link() operation
fails. We simulate this in different states:

Case 1: We don't have uncommitted data, but the link operation fails. We fall
back to try a copy/remove operation that is successfull::

    >>> with open('to_import', 'wb') as file:
    ...     _ = file.write(b'Some data.')

    >>> def failing_rename(f1, f2):
    ...   if f1 == 'to_import':
    ...       raise OSError("I can't link.")
    ...   os_rename(f1, f2)

    >>> blob = Blob()
    >>> os_rename = os.rename
    >>> os.rename = failing_rename
    >>> blob.consumeFile('to_import')

The blob did not have data before, so it shouldn't have data now::

    >>> with blob.open('r') as fp: fp.read()
    b'Some data.'

Case 2: We don't have uncommitted data and both the link operation and the
copy fail. The exception will be re-raised and the target file will not
exist::

    >>> blob = Blob()
    >>> import ZODB.utils
    >>> utils_cp = ZODB.utils.cp

    >>> def failing_copy(f1, f2):
    ...     raise OSError("I can't copy.")

    >>> ZODB.utils.cp = failing_copy
    >>> with open('to_import', 'wb') as file:
    ...     _ = file.write(b'Some data.')
    >>> blob.consumeFile('to_import')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    OSError: I can't copy.

The blob did not have data before, so it shouldn't have data now::

    >>> with blob.open('r') as fp: fp.read()
    b''

Case 3: We have uncommitted data, but the link and the copy operations fail.
The exception will be re-raised and the target file will exist with the
previous uncomitted data::

    >>> blob = Blob()
    >>> with blob.open('w') as blob_writing:
    ...     _ = blob_writing.write(b'Uncommitted data')

    >>> blob.consumeFile('to_import')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    OSError: I can't copy.

The blob did existed before and had uncommitted data, this shouldn't have
changed::

    >>> with blob.open('r') as fp: fp.read()
    b'Uncommitted data'

    >>> os.rename = os_rename
    >>> ZODB.utils.cp = utils_cp
