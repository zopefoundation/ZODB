Consuming existing files
========================

The ZODB Blob implementation allows to import existing files as Blobs within
an O(1) operation we call `consume`::

Let's create a file::

    >>> to_import = open('to_import', 'wb')
    >>> to_import.write("I'm a Blob and I feel fine.")

The file *must* be closed before giving it to consumeFile:

    >>> to_import.close()

Now, let's consume this file in a blob by specifying it's name::

    >>> from ZODB.blob import Blob
    >>> blob = Blob()
    >>> blob.consumeFile('to_import')

After the consumeFile operation, the original file has been removed:

    >>> import os
    >>> os.path.exists('to_import')
    False

We now can call open on the blob and read and write the data::

    >>> blob_read = blob.open('r')
    >>> blob_read.read()
    "I'm a Blob and I feel fine."
    >>> blob_read.close()
    >>> blob_write = blob.open('w')
    >>> blob_write.write('I was changed.')
    >>> blob_write.close()

We can not consume a file when there is a reader or writer around for a blob
already::

    >>> open('to_import', 'wb').write('I am another blob.')
    >>> blob_read = blob.open('r')
    >>> blob.consumeFile('to_import')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    BlobError: Already opened for reading.
    >>> blob_read.close()
    >>> blob_write = blob.open('w')
    >>> blob.consumeFile('to_import')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    BlobError: Already opened for writing.
    >>> blob_write.close()

Now, after closing all readers and writers we can consume files again::

    >>> blob.consumeFile('to_import')
    >>> blob_read = blob.open('r')
    >>> blob_read.read()
    'I am another blob.'


Edge cases
==========

There are some edge cases what happens when the link() operation
fails. We simulate this in different states:

Case 1: We don't have uncommitted data, but the link operation fails. The
exception will be re-raised and the target file will not exist::

    >>> open('to_import', 'wb').write('Some data.')

    >>> def failing_link(self, filename):
    ...   raise Exception("I can't link.")

    >>> blob = Blob()
    >>> blob.open('r')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    BlobError: Blob does not exist.

    >>> blob._os_link = failing_link
    >>> blob.consumeFile('to_import')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    Exception: I can't link.

The blob did not exist before, so it shouldn't exist now::

    >>> blob.open('r')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    BlobError: Blob does not exist.

Case 2: We thave uncommitted data, but the link operation fails. The
exception will be re-raised and the target file will exist with the previous
uncomitted data::

    >>> blob = Blob()
    >>> blob_writing = blob.open('w')
    >>> blob_writing.write('Uncommitted data')
    >>> blob_writing.close()

    >>> blob._os_link = failing_link
    >>> blob.consumeFile('to_import')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    Exception: I can't link.

The blob did existed before and had uncommitted data, this shouldn't have
changed::

    >>> blob.open('r').read()
    'Uncommitted data'
