Temporary directory handling with blobs
=======================================

When creating uncommitted data files for a blob (e.g. by calling
`blob.open('w')`) we need to decide where to create them. The decision depends
on whether the blob is already stored in a database or not.

Case 1: Blobs that are not in a database yet
============================================

Let's create a new blob and open it for writing::

  >>> from ZODB.blob import Blob
  >>> b = Blob()
  >>> w = b.open('w')

The created file is in the default temporary directory::

  >>> import tempfile
  >>> w.name.startswith(tempfile.gettempdir())
  True

  >>> w.close()

Case 2: Blobs that are in a database
====================================

For this case we instanciate a blob and add it to a database immediately.
First, we need a datatabase with blob support::

  >>> from ZODB.MappingStorage import MappingStorage
  >>> from ZODB.blob import BlobStorage
  >>> from ZODB.DB import DB
  >>> import os.path
  >>> base_storage = MappingStorage('test')
  >>> blob_dir = os.path.abspath('blobs')
  >>> blob_storage = BlobStorage(blob_dir, base_storage)
  >>> database = DB(blob_storage)

Now we create a blob and put it in the database. After that we open it for
writing and expect the file to be in the blob temporary directory::

  >>> blob = Blob()
  >>> connection = database.open()
  >>> connection.add(blob)
  >>> w = blob.open('w')
  >>> w.name.startswith(os.path.join(blob_dir, 'tmp'))
  True

  >>> w.close()
  >>> database.close()
