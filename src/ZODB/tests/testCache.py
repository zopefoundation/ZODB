    >>> import ZODB.MappingStorage
    >>> db = ZODB.MappingStorage.DB()

    >>> conn.cacheMinimize(); _ = gc.collect() # See fix84.rst

    >>> def check_cache_size(cache, expected):

    ...         for oid, obj in sorted(cache.items()):
    ...             print(repr(oid), " - ", obj._p_estimated_size, "bytes")


The cache is empty initially:

    >>> check_cache_size(conn._cache, 0)

We force the root to be loaded and the cache grows:

    >>> getattr(conn.root, 'z', None)
    >>> root_size = conn.root._root._p_estimated_size
    >>> check_cache_size(conn._cache, root_size)

We need to unwrap the RootConvenience to get to the actual persistent
mapping that is our root object and see its estimated size

    >>> root_size in (64, 128)
    True

.. note::

    The actual size is 60 (Python 2.6 using cPickle; would be 62 if we
    used pickle) or 65 bytes (Python 3.3) due to slight differences in
    pickle bytecode that is used.  You can play with ::

        pickletools.dis(conn._storage.load(conn.root._root._p_oid)[0]))

    to see the differences in the first pickle (encoding the object class).
    and

        pickletools.dis(conn._storage.load(conn.root._root._p_oid)[0][N:]))

    to see the differences in the second pickle (encoding the object state,
    here N is the length of the first pickle).

    These sizes are then rounded up to a multiple of 64, to fit in a
    24-bit field for obscure reasons having to do with C structure size
    BBB due to evil packages shipping their own copies of cPersistence.h.

We add some data and the cache grows:

    >>> conn.root.z = ZODB.tests.util.P('x'*100)
    >>> import transaction
    >>> transaction.commit()
    >>> root_size = conn.root._root._p_estimated_size
    >>> z_size = conn.root.z._p_estimated_size
    >>> check_cache_size(conn._cache, root_size + z_size)

Note that the size of the root object increased also, so we need to take
a new measurement

    >>> root_size in (128, 192)
    True
    >>> z_size
    192

Loading the objects in another connection gets the same sizes:

    >>> conn2 = db.open()
    >>> check_cache_size(conn2._cache, 0)
    >>> getattr(conn2.root, 'x', None)
    >>> check_cache_size(conn2._cache, root_size)
    >>> _ = conn2.root.z.name
    >>> check_cache_size(conn2._cache, root_size + z_size)

If we deactivate, the size goes down:

    >>> conn2.root.z._p_deactivate()
    >>> check_cache_size(conn2._cache, root_size)

Loading data directly, rather than through traversal updates the cache
size correctly:

    >>> conn3 = db.open()
    >>> _ = conn3.get(conn2.root.z._p_oid).name
    >>> check_cache_size(conn3._cache, z_size)
