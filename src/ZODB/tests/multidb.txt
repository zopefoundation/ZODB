==================
Multiple Databases
==================

Multi-database support adds the ability to tie multiple databases into a
collection.  The original proposal is in the fishbowl:

    http://www.zope.org/Wikis/ZODB/MultiDatabases/

It was implemented during the PyCon 2005 sprints, but in a simpler form,
by Jim Fulton, Christian Theune, and Tim Peters.  Overview:

No private attributes were added, and one new method was introduced.

``DB``:

- a new ``.database_name`` attribute holds the name of this database.

- a new ``.databases`` attribute maps from database name to ``DB`` object; all
  databases in a multi-database collection share the same ``.databases`` object

- the ``DB`` constructor has new optional arguments with the same names
  (``database_name=`` and ``databases=``).

``Connection``:

- a new ``.connections`` attribute maps from database name to a ``Connection``
  for the database with that name; the ``.connections`` mapping object is also
  shared among databases in a collection.

- a new ``.get_connection(database_name)`` method returns a ``Connection`` for
  a database in the collection; if a connection is already open, it's returned
  (this is the value ``.connections[database_name]``), else a new connection
  is opened (and stored as ``.connections[database_name]``)


Creating a multi-database starts with creating a named ``DB``:

    >>> from ZODB.tests.test_storage import MinimalMemoryStorage
    >>> from ZODB import DB
    >>> dbmap = {}
    >>> db = DB(MinimalMemoryStorage(), database_name='root', databases=dbmap)

The database name is accessible afterwards and in a newly created collection:

    >>> db.database_name
    'root'
    >>> db.databases        # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
    {'root': <ZODB.DB.DB object at ...>}
    >>> db.databases is dbmap
    True

Adding another database to the collection works like this:

    >>> db2 = DB(MinimalMemoryStorage(),
    ...     database_name='notroot',
    ...     databases=dbmap)

The new ``db2`` now shares the ``databases`` dictionary with db and has two
entries:

    >>> db2.databases is db.databases is dbmap
    True
    >>> len(db2.databases)
    2
    >>> names = sorted(dbmap.keys()); print(names)
    ['notroot', 'root']

It's an error to try to insert a database with a name already in use:

    >>> db3 = DB(MinimalMemoryStorage(),
    ...     database_name='root',
    ...     databases=dbmap)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
    ValueError: database_name 'root' already in databases

Because that failed, ``db.databases`` wasn't changed:

    >>> len(db.databases)  # still 2
    2

You can (still) get a connection to a database this way:

    >>> import transaction
    >>> tm = transaction.TransactionManager()
    >>> cn = db.open(transaction_manager=tm)
    >>> cn                  # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
    <ZODB.Connection.Connection object at ...>

This is the only connection in this collection right now:

    >>> cn.connections      # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
    {'root': <ZODB.Connection.Connection object at ...>}

Getting a connection to a different database from an existing connection in the
same database collection (this enables 'connection binding' within a given
thread/transaction/context ...):

    >>> cn2 = cn.get_connection('notroot')
    >>> cn2                  # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
    <ZODB.Connection.Connection object at ...>

The second connection gets the same transaction manager as the first:

    >>> cn2.transaction_manager is tm
    True

Now there are two connections in that collection:

    >>> cn2.connections is cn.connections
    True
    >>> len(cn2.connections)
    2
    >>> names = sorted(cn.connections.keys()); print(names)
    ['notroot', 'root']

So long as this database group remains open, the same ``Connection`` objects
are returned:

    >>> cn.get_connection('root') is cn
    True
    >>> cn.get_connection('notroot') is cn2
    True
    >>> cn2.get_connection('root') is cn
    True
    >>> cn2.get_connection('notroot') is cn2
    True

Of course trying to get a connection for a database not in the group raises
an exception:

    >>> cn.get_connection('no way')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      ...
    KeyError: 'no way'

Clean up:

    >>> for a_db in list(dbmap.values()):
    ...     a_db.close()


Configuration from File
-----------------------

The database name can also be specified in a config file, starting in
ZODB 3.6:

    >>> from ZODB.config import databaseFromString
    >>> config = """
    ... <zodb>
    ...   <mappingstorage/>
    ...   database-name this_is_the_name
    ... </zodb>
    ... """
    >>> db = databaseFromString(config)
    >>> print(db.database_name)
    this_is_the_name
    >>> sorted(db.databases.keys())
    ['this_is_the_name']

However, the ``.databases`` attribute cannot be configured from file.  It
can be passed to the `ZConfig` factory.  I'm not sure of the clearest way
to test that here; this is ugly:

    >>> from ZODB.config import getDbSchema
    >>> import ZConfig
    >>> try:
    ...     from cStringIO import StringIO
    ... except ImportError:
    ...     # Py3
    ...     from io import StringIO


Derive a new `config2` string from the `config` string, specifying a
different database_name:

    >>> config2 = config.replace("this_is_the_name", "another_name")

Now get a `ZConfig` factory from `config2`:

    >>> f = StringIO(config2)
    >>> zconfig, handle = ZConfig.loadConfigFile(getDbSchema(), f)
    >>> factory = zconfig.database

The desired ``databases`` mapping can be passed to this factory:

    >>> db2 = factory[0].open(databases=db.databases)
    >>> print(db2.database_name)   # has the right name
    another_name
    >>> db.databases is db2.databases # shares .databases with `db`
    True
    >>> all = sorted(db2.databases.keys())
    >>> all   # and db.database_name & db2.database_name are the keys
    ['another_name', 'this_is_the_name']

Cleanup.

    >>> db.close()
    >>> db2.close()
