    """The Object Database
    -------------------

    The DB class coordinates the activities of multiple database
    Connection instances.  Most of the work is done by the
    Connections created via the open method.

    The DB instance manages a pool of connections.  If a connection is
    closed, it is returned to the pool and its object cache is
    preserved.  A subsequent call to open() will reuse the connection.
    There is no hard limit on the pool size.  If more than `pool_size`
    connections are opened, a warning is logged, and if more than twice
    that many, a critical problem is logged.

    The class variable 'klass' is used by open() to create database
    connections.  It is set to Connection, but a subclass could override
    it to provide a different connection implementation.

    The database provides a few methods intended for application code
    -- open, close, undo, and pack -- and a large collection of
    methods for inspecting the database and its connections' caches.

    :Cvariables:
      - `klass`: Class used by L{open} to create database connections

    :Groups:
      - `User Methods`: __init__, open, close, undo, pack, classFactory
      - `Inspection Methods`: getName, getSize, objectCount,
        getActivityMonitor, setActivityMonitor
      - `Connection Pool Methods`: getPoolSize, getVersionPoolSize,
        removeVersionPool, setPoolSize, setVersionPoolSize
      - `Transaction Methods`: invalidate
      - `Other Methods`: lastTransaction, connectionDebugInfo
      - `Version Methods`: modifiedInVersion, abortVersion, commitVersion,
        versionEmpty
      - `Cache Inspection Methods`: cacheDetail, cacheExtremeDetail,
        cacheFullSweep, cacheLastGCTime, cacheMinimize, cacheSize,
        cacheDetailSize, getCacheSize, getVersionCacheSize, setCacheSize,
        setVersionCacheSize
      - `Deprecated Methods`: getCacheDeactivateAfter,
        setCacheDeactivateAfter,
        getVersionCacheDeactivateAfter, setVersionCacheDeactivateAfter
