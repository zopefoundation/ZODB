    CAUTION:  Methods should be called under the protection of a lock.
    This class does no locking of its own.

    There's no limit on the number of connections this can keep track of,
    but a warning is logged if there are more than pool_size active
    connections, and a critical problem if more than twice pool_size.

    New connections are registered via push().  This will log a message if
    "too many" connections are active.

    When a connection is explicitly closed, tell the pool via repush().
    That adds the connection to a stack of connections available for
    reuse, and throws away the oldest stack entries if the stack is too large.
    pop() pops this stack.

    When a connection is obtained via pop(), the pool holds only a weak
    reference to it thereafter.  It's not necessary to inform the pool
    if the connection goes away.  A connection handed out by pop() counts
    against pool_size only so long as it exists, and provided it isn't
    repush()'ed.  A weak reference is retained so that DB methods like
    connectionDebugInfo() can still gather statistics.
