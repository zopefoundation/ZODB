# So full of undocumented magic it's hard to fathom.
# The existence of cPickle.noload() isn't documented, and what it
# does isn't documented either.  In general it unpickles, but doesn't
# actually build any objects of user-defined classes.  Despite that
# persistent_load is documented to be a callable, there's an
# undocumented gimmick where if it's actually a list, for a PERSID or
# BINPERSID opcode cPickle just appends "the persistent id" to that list.
# Also despite that "a persistent id" is documented to be a string,
# ZODB persistent ids are actually (often? always?) tuples, most often
# of the form
#     (oid, (module_name, class_name))
# So the effect of the following is to dig into the object pickle, and
# return a list of the persistent ids found (which are usually nested
# tuples), without actually loading any modules or classes.
# Note that pickle.py doesn't support any of this, it's undocumented code
# only in cPickle.c.

    # to find all the persistent references within both parts (although I
    # expect they can only appear in the second part).
