# In the days of zLOG, there were 7 standard log levels, and ZODB/ZEO used
# all of them.  Here's how they map to the logging package's 5 standard
# levels:
#
#    zLOG                         logging
#    -------------                ---------------
#    PANIC (300)                  FATAL, CRITICAL (50)
#    ERROR (200)                  ERROR (40)
#    WARNING, PROBLEM (100)       WARN (30)
#    INFO (0)                     INFO (20)
#    BLATHER (-100)               none -- defined here as BLATHER (15)
#    DEBUG (-200)                 DEBUG (10)
#    TRACE (-300)                 none -- defined here as TRACE (5)
#
# TRACE is used by ZEO for extremely verbose trace output, enabled only
# when chasing bottom-level communications bugs.  It really should be at
# a lower level than DEBUG.
#
# BLATHER is a harder call, and various instances could probably be folded
# into INFO or DEBUG without real harm.

BLATHER = 15
TRACE = 5
logging.addLevelName("BLATHER", BLATHER)
logging.addLevelName("TRACE", TRACE)
