class IConnection(Interface):
    """Connection to ZODB for loading and storing objects.

    The Connection object serves as a data manager.  The root() method
    on a Connection returns the root object for the database.  This
    object and all objects reachable from it are associated with the
    Connection that loaded them.  When a transaction commits, it uses
    the Connection to store modified objects.

    Typical use of ZODB is for each thread to have its own
    Connection and that no thread should have more than one Connection
    to the same database.  A thread is associated with a Connection by
    loading objects from that Connection.  Objects loaded by one
    thread should not be used by another thread.

    A Connection can be frozen to a serial--a transaction id, a single point in
    history-- when it is created. By default, a Connection is not associated
    with a serial; it uses current data. A Connection frozen to a serial is
    read-only.

    Each Connection provides an isolated, consistent view of the
    database, by managing independent copies of objects in the
    database.  At transaction boundaries, these copies are updated to
    reflect the current state of the database.

    You should not instantiate this class directly; instead call the
    open() method of a DB instance.

    In many applications, root() is the only method of the Connection
    that you will need to use.

    Synchronization
    ---------------

    A Connection instance is not thread-safe.  It is designed to
    support a thread model where each thread has its own transaction.
    If an application has more than one thread that uses the
    connection or the transaction the connection is registered with,
    the application should provide locking.

    The Connection manages movement of objects in and out of object
    storage.

    TODO:  We should document an intended API for using a Connection via
    multiple threads.

    TODO:  We should explain that the Connection has a cache and that
    multiple calls to get() will return a reference to the same
    object, provided that one of the earlier objects is still
    referenced.  Object identity is preserved within a connection, but
    not across connections.

    TODO:  Mention the database pool.

    A database connection always presents a consistent view of the
    objects in the database, although it may not always present the
    most current revision of any particular object.  Modifications
    made by concurrent transactions are not visible until the next
    transaction boundary (abort or commit).

    Two options affect consistency.  By default, the mvcc and synch
    options are enabled by default.

    If you pass mvcc=False to db.open(), the Connection will never read
    non-current revisions of an object.  Instead it will raise a
    ReadConflictError to indicate that the current revision is
    unavailable because it was written after the current transaction
    began.

    The logic for handling modifications assumes that the thread that
    opened a Connection (called db.open()) is the thread that will use
    the Connection.  If this is not true, you should pass synch=False
    to db.open().  When the synch option is disabled, some transaction
    boundaries will be missed by the Connection; in particular, if a
    transaction does not involve any modifications to objects loaded
    from the Connection and synch is disabled, the Connection will
    miss the transaction boundary.  Two examples of this behavior are
    db.undo() and read-only transactions.

                   this is the `transaction_id` to pass to `undo()`.

        In addition, if any name+value pairs were added to the transaction
        by `setExtendedInfo()`, those may be added to the transaction
        description mapping too (for example, FileStorage's `undoLog()` does
        this).

        `filter` is a callable, taking one argument.  A transaction
        description mapping is passed to `filter` for each potentially
        undoable transaction.  The sequence returned by `undoLog()` excludes
        descriptions for which `filter` returns a false value.  By default,
        `filter` always returns a true value.

        ZEO note:  Arbitrary callables cannot be passed from a ZEO client
        to a ZEO server, and a ZEO client's implementation of `undoLog()`
        ignores any `filter` argument that may be passed.  ZEO clients
        should use the related `undoInfo()` method instead (if they want
        to do filtering).

        Now picture a list containing descriptions of all undoable
        transactions that pass the filter, most recent transaction first (at
        index 0).  The `first` and `last` arguments specify the slice of this
        (conceptual) list to be returned:

            `first`:  This is the index of the first transaction description
                      in the slice.  It must be >= 0.
            `last`:  If >= 0, first:last acts like a Python slice, selecting
                     the descriptions at indices `first`, first+1, ..., up to
                     but not including index `last`.  At most last-first
                     descriptions are in the slice, and `last` should be at
                     least as large as `first` in this case.  If `last` is
                     less than 0, then abs(last) is taken to be the maximum
                     number of descriptions in the slice (which still begins
                     at index `first`).  When `last` < 0, the same effect
                     could be gotten by passing the positive first-last for
                     `last` instead.

    Consistency and locking

    When transactions are committed, a storage assigns monotonically

    to the object versions written by the transactions.  ZODB relies
    on this to decide if data in object caches are up to date and to
    implement multi-version concurrency control.

    There are methods in IStorage and in derived interfaces that
    provide information about the current revisions (tids) for objects
    or for the database as a whole.  It is critical for the proper
    working of ZODB that the resulting tids are increasing with
    respect to the object identifier given or to the databases.  That
    is, if there are 2 results for an object or for the database, R1
    and R2, such that R1 is returned before R2, then the tid returned
    by R2 must be greater than or equal to the tid returned by R1.
    (When thinking about results for the database, think of these as
    results for all objects in the database.)

    This implies some sort of locking strategy.  The key method is
    tcp_finish, which causes new tids to be generated and also,
    through the callback passed to it, returns new current tids for
    the objects stored in a transaction and for the database as a whole.

                   this is the `transaction_id` to pass to `undo()`.

        In addition, if any name+value pairs were added to the transaction
        by `setExtendedInfo()`, those may be added to the transaction
        description mapping too (for example, FileStorage's `undoLog()` does
        this).

        `filter` is a callable, taking one argument.  A transaction
        description mapping is passed to `filter` for each potentially
        undoable transaction.  The sequence returned by `undoLog()` excludes
        descriptions for which `filter` returns a false value.  By default,
        `filter` always returns a true value.

        ZEO note:  Arbitrary callables cannot be passed from a ZEO client
        to a ZEO server, and a ZEO client's implementation of `undoLog()`
        ignores any `filter` argument that may be passed.  ZEO clients
        should use the related `undoInfo()` method instead (if they want
        to do filtering).

        Now picture a list containing descriptions of all undoable
        transactions that pass the filter, most recent transaction first (at
        index 0).  The `first` and `last` arguments specify the slice of this
        (conceptual) list to be returned:

            `first`:  This is the index of the first transaction description
                      in the slice.  It must be >= 0.
            `last`:  If >= 0, first:last acts like a Python slice, selecting
                     the descriptions at indices `first`, first+1, ..., up to
                     but not including index `last`.  At most last-first
                     descriptions are in the slice, and `last` should be at
                     least as large as `first` in this case.  If `last` is
                     less than 0, then abs(last) is taken to be the maximum
                     number of descriptions in the slice (which still begins
                     at index `first`).  When `last` < 0, the same effect
                     could be gotten by passing the positive first-last for
                     `last` instead.

class IMVCCStorage(IStorage):
    """A storage that provides MVCC semantics internally.

    MVCC (multi-version concurrency control) means each user of a
    database has a snapshot view of the database. The snapshot view
    does not change, even if concurrent connections commit
    transactions, until a transaction boundary. Relational databases
    that support serializable transaction isolation provide MVCC.

    Storages that implement IMVCCStorage, such as RelStorage, provide
    MVCC semantics at the ZODB storage layer. When ZODB.Connection uses
    a storage that implements IMVCCStorage, each connection uses a
    connection-specific storage instance, and that storage instance
    provides a snapshot of the database.

    By contrast, storages that do not implement IMVCCStorage, such as
    FileStorage, rely on ZODB.Connection to provide MVCC semantics, so
    in that case, one storage instance is shared by many
    ZODB.Connections. Applications that use ZODB.Connection always have
    a snapshot view of the database; IMVCCStorage only modifies which
    layer of ZODB provides MVCC.

    Furthermore, IMVCCStorage changes the way object invalidation
    works. An essential feature of ZODB is the propagation of object
    invalidation messages to keep in-memory caches up to date. Storages
    like FileStorage and ZEO.ClientStorage send invalidation messages
    to all other Connection instances at transaction commit time.
    Storages that implement IMVCCStorage, on the other hand, expect the
    ZODB.Connection to poll for a list of invalidated objects.

    Certain methods of IMVCCStorage implementations open persistent
    back end database sessions and retain the sessions even after the
    method call finishes::

        load
        loadEx
        loadSerial
        loadBefore
        store
        restore

        history
        tpc_begin
        tpc_vote
        tpc_abort
        tpc_finish

    If you know that the storage instance will no longer be used after
    calling any of these methods, you should call the release method to
    release the persistent sessions. The persistent sessions will be
    reopened as necessary if you call one of those methods again.

    Other storage methods open short lived back end sessions and close
    the back end sessions before returning. These include::

        __len__
        getSize
        undoLog
        undo
        pack
        iterator

    These methods do not provide MVCC semantics, so these methods

    snapshot view that the other methods use.
