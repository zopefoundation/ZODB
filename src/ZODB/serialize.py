"""Support for ZODB object serialization.

ZODB serializes objects using a custom format based on Python pickles.
When an object is unserialized, it can be loaded as either a ghost or
a real object.  A ghost is a persistent object of the appropriate type
but without any state.  The first time a ghost is accessed, the
persistence machinery traps access and loads the actual state.  A
ghost allows many persistent objects to be loaded while minimizing the
memory consumption of referenced but otherwise unused objects.

Pickle format
-------------

ZODB stores serialized objects using a custom format based on pickle.
Each serialized object has two parts: the class description and the
object state.  The class description must provide enough information
to call the class's ``__new__`` and create an empty object.  Once the
object exists as a ghost, its state is passed to ``__setstate__``.

The class description can be in a variety of formats, in part to
provide backwards compatibility with earlier versions of Zope.  The
four current formats for class description are:

    1. type(obj)
    2. type(obj), obj.__getnewargs__()
    3. (module name, class name), None
    7. (module name, class name), obj.__getnewargs__()

The second of these options is used if the object has a __getnewargs__()
method.  It is intended to support objects like persistent classes that have
custom C layouts that are determined by arguments to __new__().  The
third and fourth (#3 & #7) apply to instances of a persistent class (which
means the class itself is persistent, not that it's a subclass of
Persistent).

The type object is usually stored using the standard pickle mechanism, which
involves the pickle GLOBAL opcode (giving the type's module and name as
strings).  The type may itself be a persistent object, in which case a
persistent reference (see below) is used.

It's unclear what "usually" means in the last paragraph.  There are two
useful places to concentrate confusion about exactly which formats exist:

- ObjectReader.getClassName() below returns a dotted "module.class"
  string, via actually loading a pickle.  This requires that the
  implementation of application objects be available.

- ZODB/utils.py's get_pickle_metadata() tries to return the module and
  class names (as strings) without importing any application modules or
  classes, via analyzing the pickle.

Earlier versions of Zope supported several other kinds of class
descriptions.  The current serialization code reads these descriptions, but
does not write them.  The three earlier formats are:

    4. (module name, class name), __getinitargs__()
    5. class, None
    6. class, __getinitargs__()

Formats 4 and 6 are used only if the class defines a __getinitargs__()
method, but we really can't tell them apart from formats 7 and 2
(respectively).  Formats 5 and 6 are used if the class does not have a
__module__ attribute (I'm not sure when this applies, but I think it occurs
for some but not all ZClasses).


Persistent references
---------------------

When one persistent object pickle refers to another persistent object,
the database uses a persistent reference.

ZODB persistent references are of the form::

oid
    A simple object reference.

(oid, class meta data)
    A persistent object reference

[reference_type, args]
    An extended reference

    Extension references come in a number of subforms, based on the
    reference types.

    The following reference types are defined:

    'w'
        Persistent weak reference.  The arguments consist of an oid
        and optionally a database name.

    The following are planned for the future:

    'n'
        Multi-database simple object reference.  The arguments consist
        of a database name, and an object id.

    'm'
        Multi-database persistent object reference.  The arguments consist
        of a database name, an object id, and class meta data.

The following legacy format is also supported.

[oid]
    A persistent weak reference

Because the persistent object reference forms include class
information, it is not possible to change the class of a persistent
object for which this form is used.  If a transaction changed the
class of an object, a new record with new class metadata would be
written but all the old references would still use the old class.  (It
is possible that we could deal with this limitation in the future.)

An object id is used alone when a class requires arguments
to it's __new__ method, which is signalled by the class having a
__getnewargs__ attribute.

A number of legacyforms are defined:

        Normally, object references include the oid and a cached named
        reference to the class.  Having the class information
        available allows fast creation of the ghost, avoiding
        requiring an additional database lookup.

        >>> oid

        To work with Python 3, the oid in the persistent id is of the
        zodbpickle binary type:

        >>> oid.__class__ is binary
        True


        If a persistent object does not already have an oid and jar,
        these will be assigned by persistent_id():

        >>> bob._p_oid
        '42'
        >>> bob._p_jar is jar
        True

        If the object already has a persistent id, the id is not changed:

        >>> bob._p_oid = b'24'
        >>> oid, cls = writer.persistent_id(bob)
        >>> oid
        '24'
        >>> cls is P
        True

        If the jar doesn't match that of the writer, an error is raised:

        >>> bob._p_jar = DummyJar()
        >>> writer.persistent_id(bob)
        ... # doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE +ELLIPSIS

        InvalidObjectReference:
        ('Attempt to store an object from a foreign database connection',
        <ZODB.serialize.DummyJar ...>, P(bob))

        Constructor arguments used by __new__(), as returned by
        __getnewargs__(), can affect memory allocation, but may also
        change over the life of the object.  This makes it useless to
        cache even the object's class.
