# a Connection alive keeps a potentially huge number of other objects
# alive (e.g., the cache, and everything reachable from it too).
# Therefore we use "weak sets" internally.

# Call the ISynchronizer newTransaction() method on every element of
# WeakSet synchs.
# A transaction manager needs to do this whenever begin() is called.
# Since it would be good if tm.get() returned the new transaction while
# newTransaction() is running, calling this has to be delayed until after
# the transaction manager has done whatever it needs to do to make its
# get() return the new txn.

# constructor:  synchronizers are registered with the TM, but the
# ISynchronizer xyzCompletion() methods are called by Transactions without
# consulting the TM, so we need to pass a mutable collection of synchronizers
# so that Transactions "see" synchronizers that get registered after the
