"""Transaction objects manage resources for an individual activity.

Compatibility issues
--------------------

The implementation of Transaction objects involves two layers of
backwards compatibility, because this version of transaction supports
both ZODB 3 and ZODB 4.  Zope is evolving towards the ZODB4
interfaces.

Transaction has two methods for a resource manager to call to
participate in a transaction -- register() and join().  join() takes a
resource manager and adds it to the list of resources.  register() is
for backwards compatibility.  It takes a persistent object and
registers its _p_jar attribute.  TODO: explain adapter

Subtransactions
---------------

Note: Suntransactions are deprecated!  Use savepoint/rollback instead.

A subtransaction applies the transaction notion recursively.  It
allows a set of modifications within a transaction to be committed or
aborted as a group.  A subtransaction is a strictly local activity;
its changes are not visible to any other database connection until the
top-level transaction commits.  In addition to its use to organize a
large transaction, subtransactions can be used to optimize memory use.
ZODB must keep modified objects in memory until a transaction commits
and it can write the changes to the storage.  A subtransaction uses a
temporary disk storage for its commits, allowing modified objects to
be flushed from memory when the subtransaction commits.

The commit() and abort() methods take an optional subtransaction
argument that defaults to false.  If it is a true, the operation is
performed on a subtransaction.

Subtransactions add a lot of complexity to the transaction
implementation.  Some resource managers support subtransactions, but
they are not required to.  (ZODB Connection is the only standard
resource manager that supports subtransactions.)  Resource managers
that do support subtransactions implement abort_sub() and commit_sub()
methods and support a second argument to tpc_begin().

The second argument to tpc_begin() indicates that a subtransaction
commit is beginning (if it is true).  In a subtransaction, there is no
tpc_vote() call, because sub-transactions don't need 2-phase commit.
If a sub-transaction abort or commit fails, we can abort the outer
transaction.  The tpc_finish() or tpc_abort() call applies just to
that subtransaction.

Once a resource manager is involved in a subtransaction, all
subsequent transactions will be treated as subtransactions until
abort_sub() or commit_sub() is called.  abort_sub() will undo all the
changes of the subtransactions.  commit_sub() will begin a top-level
transaction and store all the changes from subtransactions.  After
commit_sub(), the transaction must still call tpc_vote() and
tpc_finish().

If the resource manager does not support subtransactions, nothing
happens when the subtransaction commits.  Instead, the resource
manager is put on a list of managers to commit when the actual
top-level transaction commits.  If this happens, it will not be
possible to abort subtransactions.

Two-phase commit
----------------

A transaction commit involves an interaction between the transaction
object and one or more resource managers.  The transaction manager
calls the following four methods on each resource manager; it calls
tpc_begin() on each resource manager before calling commit() on any of
them.

    1. tpc_begin(txn)
    2. commit(txn)
    3. tpc_vote(txn)
    4. tpc_finish(txn)

Subtransaction commit
---------------------

Note: Subtransactions are deprecated!

When a subtransaction commits, the protocol is different.

1. tpc_begin() is passed a second argument, which indicates that a
   subtransaction is being committed.
2. tpc_vote() is not called.

Once a subtransaction has been committed, the top-level transaction
commit will start with a commit_sub() call instead of a tpc_begin()
call.

Before-commit hook
---------------

Sometimes, applications want to execute some code when a transaction is
committed.  For example, one might want to delay object indexing until a
transaction commits, rather than indexing every time an object is changed.
Or someone might want to check invariants only after a set of operations.  A
pre-commit hook is available for such use cases, just use beforeCommitHook()
passing it a callable and arguments.  The callable will be called with its
arguments at the start of the commit (but not for substransaction commits).

Error handling
--------------

When errors occur during two-phase commit, the transaction manager
aborts all the resource managers.  The specific methods it calls
depend on whether the error occurs before or after the call to
tpc_vote() on that transaction manager.

If the resource manager has not voted, then the resource manager will
have one or more uncommitted objects.  There are two cases that lead
to this state; either the transaction manager has not called commit()
for any objects on this resource manager or the call that failed was a
commit() for one of the objects of this resource manager.  For each
uncommitted object, including the object that failed in its commit(),
call abort().

Once uncommitted objects are aborted, tpc_abort() or abort_sub() is
called on each resource manager.

Synchronization
---------------

You can register sychronization objects (synchronizers) with the
tranasction manager.  The synchronizer must implement
beforeCompletion() and afterCompletion() methods.  The transaction
manager calls beforeCompletion() when it starts a top-level two-phase
commit.  It calls afterCompletion() when a top-level transaction is
committed or aborted.  The methods are passed the current Transaction
as their only argument.
