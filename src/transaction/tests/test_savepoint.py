A savepoint needs to not just rollback it's savepoints, but needs to
rollback savepoints for data managers that joined savepoints after the
savepoint:

    >>> import transaction.tests.savepointsample
    >>> dm = transaction.tests.savepointsample.SampleSavepointDataManager()
    >>> dm['name'] = 'bob'
    >>> sp1 = transaction.savepoint()
    >>> dm['job'] = 'geek'
    >>> sp2 = transaction.savepoint()
    >>> dm['salary'] = 'fun'    
    >>> dm2 = transaction.tests.savepointsample.SampleSavepointDataManager()
    >>> dm2['name'] = 'sally'

    >>> 'name' in dm
    True
    >>> 'job' in dm
    True
    >>> 'salary' in dm
    True
    >>> 'name' in dm2
