class ResourceManager(object):
    """Sample resource manager.

       This class provides a trivial resource-manager implementation and doc
       strings to illustrate the protocol and to provide a tool for writing
       tests.

       Our sample resource manager has state that is updated through an inc
       method and through transaction operations.

       When we create a sample resource manager:

       >>> rm = ResourceManager()

       It has two pieces state, state and delta, both initialized to 0:

       >>> rm.state
       0
       >>> rm.delta
       0

       state is meant to model committed state, while delta represents
       tentative changes within a transaction.  We change the state by
       calling inc:

       >>> rm.inc()

       which updates delta:

       >>> rm.delta
       1

       but state isn't changed until we commit the transaction:

       >>> rm.state
       0

       To commit the changes, we use 2-phase commit.  We execute the first
       stage by calling prepare.  We need to pass a transation. Our
       sample resource managers don't really use the transactions for much,
       so we'll be lazy and use strings for transactions.  The sample
       resource manager updates the state when we call tpc_vote:


       >>> t1 = '1'
       >>> rm.tpc_begin(t1)
       >>> rm.state, rm.delta
       (0, 1)

       >>> rm.tpc_vote(t1)
       >>> rm.state, rm.delta
       (1, 1)

       Now if we call tpc_finish:

       >>> rm.tpc_finish(t1)

       Our changes are "permanent".  The state reflects the changes and the
       delta has been reset to 0.

       >>> rm.state, rm.delta
       (1, 0)

        Savepoints provide a way to:

        - Save partial transaction work. For some resource managers, this
          could allow resources to be used more efficiently.

        - Provide the ability to revert state to a point in a
          transaction without aborting the entire transaction.  In
          other words, savepoints support partial aborts.

        Savepoints don't use two-phase commit. If there are errors in
        setting or rolling back to savepoints, the application should
        abort the containing transaction.  This is *not* the
        responsibility of the resource manager.

        Savepoints are always associated with a transaction. Any work
        done in a savepoint's transaction is tentative until the
        transaction is committed using two-phase commit.

        If we rollback to an earlier savepoint, we discard all work
        done later:

        >>> r1.rollback()
        >>> rm.state, rm.delta
        (1, 0)

        and we can no longer rollback to the later savepoint:
