Overriding `__getattr__`, `__getattribute__`, `__setattr__`, and `__delattr__`
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Subclasses can override the attribute-management methods.  For the
`__getattr__` method, the behavior is like that for regular Python
classes and for earlier versions of ZODB 3.

For `__getattribute__`, __setattr__`, and `__delattr__`, it is necessary
to call certain methods defined by `persistent.Persistent`.  Detailed
examples and documentation is provided in the test module,
`persistent.tests.test_overriding_attrs`.
