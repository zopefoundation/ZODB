This document provides information for developers who maintain or
extend BTrees.

Macros
======
BTrees are defined using a "template", roughly akin to a a C++
template.  To create a new family of BTrees, create a source file that
defines macros used to handle differences in key and value types:


Configuration Macros

MASTER_ID
A string to hold an RCS/CVS Id key to be included in compiled binaries.

MOD_NAME_PREFIX
A string (like "IO" or "OO") that provides the prefix used for the
module.  This gets used to generate type names and the internal module
name string.

DEFAULT_MAX_BUCKET_SIZE
An int giving the maximum bucket size (number of key/value pairs).
When a bucket gets larger than this due to an insertion *into a BTREE*,
it splits.  Inserting into a bucket directly doesn't split, and
functions that produce a bucket output (e.g., union()) also have no
bound on how large a bucket may get.  Someday this will be tunable
on BTree instances.

DEFAULT_MAX_BTREE_SIZE
An int giving the maximum size (number of children) of an internal
btree node.  Someday this will be tunable on BTree instances.

Macros for Keys

KEY_TYPE
The C type declaration for keys (e.g., int or PyObject*).

KEY_CHECK(K)
Tests whether the PyObject* K can be converted to the (C) key type
(KEY_TYPE).  The macro should return a boolean (zero for false,
non-zero for true).  When it returns false, its caller should probably
set a TypeError exception.

TEST_KEY_SET_OR(V, K, T)
Like Python's cmp().  Compares K(ey) to T(arget), where K & T are C
values of type KEY_TYPE.  V is assigned an int value depending on
the outcome:
   < 0 if K < T
  == 0 if K == T
   > 0 if K > T
This macro acts like an 'if', where the following statement is
executed only if a Python exception has been raised because the
values could not be compared.

DECREF_KEY(K)
K is a value of KEY_TYPE.  If KEY_TYPE is a flavor of PyObject*, write
this to do Py_DECREF(K).  Else (e.g., KEY_TYPE is int) make it a nop.

INCREF_KEY(K)
K is a value of KEY_TYPE.  If KEY_TYPE is a flavor of PyObject*, write
this to do Py_INCREF(K).  Else (e.g., KEY_TYPE is int) make it a nop.

COPY_KEY(K, E)
Like K=E.  Copy a key from E to K, both of KEY_TYPE.  Note that this
doesn't decref K or incref E when KEY_TYPE is a PyObject*; the caller
is responsible for keeping refcounts straight.

COPY_KEY_TO_OBJECT(O, K)
Roughly like O=K.  O is a PyObject*, and the macro must build a Python
object form of K, assign it to O, and ensure that O owns the reference
to its new value.  It may do this by creating a new Python object based
on K (e.g., PyInt_FromLong(K) when KEY_TYPE is int), or simply by doing
Py_INCREF(K) if KEY_TYPE is a PyObject*.

COPY_KEY_FROM_ARG(TARGET, ARG, STATUS)
Copy an argument to the target without creating a new reference to ARG.
ARG is a PyObject*, and TARGET is of type KEY_TYPE.  If this can't be
done (for example, KEY_CHECK(ARG) returns false), set a Python error
and set status to 0.  If there is no error, leave status alone.


Macros for Values

VALUE_TYPE
The C type declaration for values (e.g., int or PyObject*).

TEST_VALUE(X, Y)
Like Python's cmp().  Compares X to Y, where X & Y are C values of
type VALUE_TYPE.  The macro returns an int, with value
   < 0 if X < Y
  == 0 if X == Y
   > 0 if X > Y
XXX There is no provision for determining whether the comparison
attempt failed (set a Python exception).

DECREF_VALUE(K)
Like DECREF_KEY, except applied to values of VALUE_TYPE.

INCREF_VALUE(K)
Like INCREF_KEY, except applied to values of VALUE_TYPE.

COPY_VALUE(K, E)
Like COPY_KEY, except applied to values of VALUE_TYPE.

COPY_VALUE_TO_OBJECT(O, K)
Like COPY_KEY_TO_OBJECT, except applied to values of VALUE_TYPE.

COPY_VALUE_FROM_ARG(TARGET, ARG, STATUS)
Like COPY_KEY_FROM_ARG, except applied to values of VALUE_TYPE.

NORMALIZE_VALUE(V, MIN)
Normalize the value, V, using the parameter MIN.  This is almost
certainly a YAGNI.  It is a no op for most types. For integers, V is
replaced by V/MIN only if MIN > 0.


Macros for Set Operations

MERGE_DEFAULT
A value of VALUE_TYPE specifying the value to associate with set
elements when sets are merged with mappings via weighed union or
weighted intersection.

MERGE(O1, w1, O2, w2)
Performs a weighted merge of two values, O1 and O2, using weights w1
and w2.  The result must be of VALUE_TYPE.  Note that weighted unions
and weighted intersections are not enabled if this macro is left
undefined.

MERGE_WEIGHT(O, w)
Computes a weighted value for O.  The result must be of VALUE_TYPE.
This is used for "filling out" weighted unions, i.e. to compute a
weighted value for keys that appear in only one of the input
mappings.  If left undefined, MERGE_WEIGHT defaults to

    #define MERGE_WEIGHT(O, w) (O)

MULTI_INT_UNION
The value doesn't matter.  If defined, SetOpTemplate.c compiles
code for a multiunion() function (compute a union of many input sets
at high speed).  This currently makes sense only for II sets, so
only _IIBTree.c defines it.


BTree Clues
===========
More or less random bits of helpful info.

+ In papers and textbooks, this flavor of BTree is usually called
  a B+-Tree, where "+" is a superscript.

+ All keys and all values live in the bucket leaf nodes.  Keys in
  interior (BTree) nodes merely serve to guide a search efficiently
  toward the correct leaf.

+ When a key is deleted, it's physically removed from the bucket
  it's in, but this doesn't propagate back up the tree:  since keys
  in interior nodes only serve to guide searches, it's OK-- and
  saves time --to leave "stale" keys in interior nodes.

+ No attempt is made to rebalance the tree after a deletion, unless
  a bucket thereby becomes entirely empty.  "Classic BTrees" do
  rebalance, keeping all buckets at least half full (provided there
  are enough keys in the entire tree to fill half a bucket).  The
  tradeoffs are murky.  Pathological cases in the presence of
  deletion do exist.  Pathologies include trees tending toward only
  one key per bucket, and buckets at differing depths (all buckets
  are at the same depth in a classic BTree).

+ DEFAULT_MAX_BUCKET_SIZE and DEFAULT_MAX_BTREE_SIZE are chosen
  mostly to "even out" pickle sizes in storage.  That's why, e.g.,
  an IIBTree has large values than an OOBTree:  pickles store ints
  more efficiently than they can store arbitrary Python objects.
