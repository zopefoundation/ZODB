3.9.0a1 (2008-??-??)
====================

New Features
------------

- The connection now estimates the object size based on its pickle size
  and informs the cache about size changes.

  The database got additional configurations options (`cache-size-bytes`
  and `historical-cache-size-bytes`) to limit the
  cache size based on the estimated total size of cached objects.
  The default values are 0 which has the interpretation "do not limit
  based on the total estimated size".
  There are corresponding methods to read and set the new configuration
  parameters.

- Cleaned-up the storage iteration API and provided an iterator implementation
  for ZEO.

- Versions are no-longer supported.

- ZEO cache files can be larger than 4G. Note that older ZEO cache
  files are not supported.

- Document conflict resolution (see ZODB/ConflictResolution.txt).

- Support multidatabase references in conflict resolution.

- Make it possible to examine oid and (in some situations) database
  name of persistent object references during conflict resolution.

- Moved 'transaction' module out of ZODB.
  ZODB depends upon this module, but it must be installed separately.

- ZODB installation now requires setuptools.

- Added `offset` information to output of `fstail`
  script. Added test harness for this script.

- Added support for read-only, historical connections based
  on datetimes or serials (TIDs).  See
  src/ZODB/historical_connections.txt.

- Removed the ThreadedAsync module.

Bugs Fixed
----------

- Fix for bug #251037: Make packing of blob storages non-blocking.

- Fix for bug #220856: Completed implementation of ZEO authentication.

- Fix for bug #184057: Make initialisation of small ZEO client file cache
  sizes not fail.

- Fix for bug #184054: MappingStorage used to raise a KeyError during `load`
  instead of a POSKeyError.

- Fixed bug in Connection.TmpStore: load() would not defer to the backend
  storage for loading blobs.

- Fix for bug #181712: Make ClientStorage update `lastTransaction` directly
  after connecting to a server, even when no cache verification is necessary.

- Fixed bug in blob filesystem helper: the `isSecure` check was inversed.

- Fixed bug in transaction buffer: a tuple was unpacked incorrectly in
  `clear`.

- Bugfix the situation in which comparing persistent objects (for
  instance, as members in BTree set or keys of BTree) might cause data
  inconsistency during conflict resolution.

- Fixed bug 153316: persistent and BTrees were using `int`
  for memory sizes which caused errors on x86_64 Intel Xeon machines
  (using 64-bit Linux).
  
- Fixed small bug that the Connection.isReadOnly method didn't
  work after a savepoint.

- Bug #98275: Made ZEO cache more tolerant when invalidating current
  versions of objects.

- Fixed a serious bug that could cause client I/O to stop
  (hang). This was accomonied by a critical log message along the
  lines of: "RuntimeError: dictionary changed size during iteration".

- Fixed bug #127182: Blobs were subclassable which was not desired.

- Fixed bug #126007: tpc_abort had untested code path that was
  broken.

- Fixed bug #129921: getSize() function in BlobStorage could not
  deal with garbage files

- Fixed bug in which MVCC would not work for blobs.

- Fixed bug in ClientCache that occurred with objects larger than the total
  cache size.

3.8.1b8 (2008-09-??)
====================

Bugs Fixed:

- Refactored handling of invalidations on ZEO clients to fix
  a possible ordering problem for invalidation messages.

- An ZEO cache internal data structure can get out of sync
  with the data in a way that prevents data from being loaded into the
  cache. We don't yet know why, but added an exception handler to
  prevent this error from being fatal.

- Fixed setup.py use of setuptools vs distutils, so .c and .h
  files are included in the bdist_egg.

- On many systems, it was impossible to create more than 32K
  blobs. Added a new blob-directory layout to work around this
  limitation.


3.8.1b7 (2008-08-23)
====================

Bugs Fixed:

- Fixed a bug, introduced in an earlier beta, that allowed
  clients to connect to out of date servers.

- Fixed bug that could lead to memory errors due to the use
  of a Python dictionary for a mapping that can grow large.

- Fixed bug #251037: Made packing of blob storages non-blocking.

3.8.1b6 (2008-07-24)
====================

Bugs Fixed:

- Fixed a bug that could cause InvalidObjectReference errors
  for objects that were explicitly added to a database if the object
  was modified after a savepoint that added the object.

3.8.1b5 (2008-07-14)
====================

Bugs Fixed:

- Fixed several bugs that caused ZEO cache corruption when connecting
  to servers. These bugs affected both persistent and non-persistent caches. 

- Improved the the ZEO client shutdown support to try to
  avoid spurious errors on exit, especially for scripts, such as zeopack.

3.8.1b4 (2008-05-23)
====================

Bugs Fixed:

- Packing failed for databases containing cross-database references.

3.8.1b3 (2008-05-14)
====================

Bugs Fixed:

- Cross-database references to databases with empty names
  weren't constructed properly.

3.8.1b2 (2008-05-13)
====================

Bugs Fixed:

- The cache used an excessive amount of memory, causing applications
  with large caches to exhaust available memory. 

3.8.1b1 (2008-05-08)
====================

Bugs Fixed:

- Fixed a number of bugs in the handling of persistent ZEO caches:

  - Cache records are written in several steps.  If a process exits
    after writing begins and before it is finishes, the cache will be
    corrupt on restart.  The way records are writted was changed to
    make cache record updates atomic.

  - There was no lock file to prevent opening a cache multiple times
    at once, which would lead to corruption.  Persistent caches now
    use lock files, in the same way that file storages do.

  - A bug in the cache-opening logic led to cache failure in the
    unlikely event that a cache has no free blocks.

- When using ZEO Client Storages, Errors occured when trying to store
  objects too big to fit in the ZEO cache file.

- Fixed bug in blob filesystem helper: the `isSecure` check was inversed.

- Fixed bug in transaction buffer: a tuple was unpacked incorrectly in
  `clear`.

- Fixed bug in Connection.TmpStore: load() would not defer to the
  backend storage for loading blobs.

- Fixed bug #190884: Wrong reference to `POSKeyError` caused NameError.

- Completed implementation of ZEO authentication. This fixes issue 220856.
