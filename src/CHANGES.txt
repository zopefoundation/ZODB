3.10.0b6 (2010-09-08)
=====================

Bugs fixed
----------

- Process exits or database closes could cause ZEO caches to have
  incorrect data due to a problem in the way invalidations were processed.

- Database connections didn't invalidate cache entries when conflict
  errors were raised in response to checkCurrentSerialInTransaction
  errors. Normally, this shouldn't be a problem, since there should be
  pending invalidations for these oids which will cause the object to
  be invalidated. There have been issues with ZEO persistent cache
  management that have caused out of date data to remain in the cache.
  (It's possible that the last of these were addressed in the
  3.10.0b5.) Invalidating read data when there is a conflict error
  provides some extra insurance.

- The interface, ZODB.interfaces.IStorage was incorrect. The store
  method should never return a sequence of oid and serial pairs.

3.10.0b5 (2010-09-02)
=====================

Bugs fixed
----------

- Added a new API that allows applications to make sure that current
  data are read. For example, with::

    self._p_jar.readCurrent(ob)

  A conflict error will be raised if the version of ob read by the
  transaction isn't current when the transaction is committed.

  Normally, ZODB only assures that objects read are consistent, but not
  necessarily up to date.  Checking whether an object is up to date is
  important when information read from one object is used to update
  another.

  BTrees are an important case of reading one object to update
  another.  Internal nodes are read to decide which leave notes are
  updated when a BTree is updated.  BTrees now use this new API to
  make sure that internal nodes are up to date on updates.

- Shutting down a process while committing a transaction could cause
  ZEO client caches to have invalid data.  This, in turn caused stale
  data to remain in the cache until it was updated.

- Removed untested unsupported dbmstorage fossile.

3.10.0b4 (2010-07-19)
=====================

Bugs fixed
----------

- When an integer too large to fit in a 32-bit integer was provided as
  a 32-bit-integer BTree key or value on 64-bit machines, an
  OverflowError was raised. Now a TypeError is raised.

3.10.0b3 (2010-07-15)
=====================

Bugs fixed
----------

- A change in 3.10.0b2:

  "DemoStorages didn't close their changes databases when they were
   created temporarily (not passed to the constructor)."

  Introduced a backward-compatibility problem for some applications.

  This change was reverted.

3.10.0b2 (2010-07-13)
=====================

Bugs fixed
----------

- Updating blobs in save points could cause spurious "invalidations
  out of order" errors.  https://bugs.launchpad.net/zodb/+bug/509801

  (Thanks to Christian Zagrodnick for chasing this down.)

- When a demo storage push method was used to create a new demo
  storage and the new storage was closed, the original was
  (incorrectly) closed.

- DemoStorages didn't close their changes databases when they were
  created temporarily (not passed to the constructor).

- Passing keys or values outside the range of 32-bit ints on 64-bit
  platforms led to undetected overflow errors. Now these cases cause
  Overflow errors to be raised.

  https://bugs.launchpad.net/zodb/+bug/143237

- There were numerous bugs in the ZEO cache tracing and analysys code.
  Cache simulation, while not perfect, seems to be much more accurate
  now than it was before.

  The ZEO cache trace statistics and simulation scripts have been
  given more descriptive names and moved to the ZEO scripts package.

- If a ZEO client process was restarted while invalidating a ZEO cache
  entry, the cache could be left in a stage when there is data marked
  current that should be invalidated, leading to persistent conflict
  errors.

- Corrupted or invalid cache files prevented ZEO clients from
  starting. Now, bad cache files are moved aside.

- Invalidations of object records in ZEO caches, where the
  invalidation transaction ids matched the cached transaction ids
  should have been ignored.

- Conflict errors didn't invalidate ZEO cache entries.


3.10.0b1 (2010-05-18)
=====================

New Features
------------

- DemoStorages now accept constructor athuments, close_base_on_close
  and close_changes_on_close, to control whether underlying storages
  are closed when the DemoStorage is closed.

  https://bugs.launchpad.net/zodb/+bug/118512

- Removed the dependency on zope.proxy.

- Removed support for the _p_independent mini framework, which was
  made moot by the introduction of multi-version concurrency control
  several years ago.

- Added support for the transaction retry convenience
  (transaction-manager attempts method) introduced in the
  ``transaction`` 1.1.0 release.

- Enhanced the database opening conveniences:

  - You can now pass storage keyword arguments to ZODB.DB and
    ZODB.connection.

  - You can now pass None (rather than a storage or file name) to get
    a database with a mapping storage.

- Databases now warn when committing very large records (> 16MB).
  This is to try to warn people of likely design mistakes.  There is a
  new option (large_record_size/large-record-size) to control the
  record size at which the warning is issued.

- Added support for wrapper storages that transform pickle data.
  Applications for this include compression and encryption.  An
  example wrapper storage implementation, ZODB.tests.hexstorage, was
  included for testing.

  It is important that storage implementations not assume that
  storages contain pickles.  Renamed IStorageDB to IStorageWrapper and
  expanded it to provide methods for transforming and untransforming
  data records.  Storages implementations should use these methods to
  get pickle data from stored records.

- Deprecated ZODB.interfaces.StorageStopIteration.  Storage
  iterator implementations should just raise StopIteration, which
  means they can now be implemented as generators.

- The file-storage backup script, repoze, will now create a backup
  index file if an output file name is given via the --output/-o
  option.

- The filestorage packer configuration option noe accepts calues of
  the form ``modname:expression``, allowing the use of packer
  factories with options.

Bugs Fixed
----------

- BTree sets and tree sets didn't correctly check values passed to
  update or to constructors, causing Python to exit under certain
  circumstances.

3.10.0a2 (2010-05-04)
=====================

New Features
------------

- Added a '--kill-old-on-full' argument to the backup options:  if passed,
  remove any older full or incremental backup files from the repository after
  doing a full backup. (https://bugs.launchpad.net/zope2/+bug/143158)

- When transactions are aborted, new object ids allocated during the
  transaction are saved and used in subsequent transactions. This can
  help in situations where object ids are used as BTree keys and the
  sequential allocation of object ids leads to conflict errors.

- ZEO servers now support a server_status method for for getting
  information on the number of clients, lock requests and general
  statistics.

- ZEO clients now support a client_label constructor argument and
  client-label configuration-file option to specify a label for a
  client in server logs. This makes it easier to identify specific
  clients corresponding to server log entries, especially when there
  are multiple clients originating from the same machine.

- The mkzeoinst script has been moved to a separate project:

    http://pypi.python.org/pypi/zope.mkzeoinstance

  and is no-longer included with ZODB.

- Improved ZEO server commit lock logging.  Now, locking activity is
  logged at the debug level until the number of waiting lock requests
  gets above 3.  Log at the critical level when the number of waiting
  lock requests gets above 9.

- ZEO servers no longer log their pids in every log message. It's just
  not interesting. :)

Bugs Fixed
----------

- Fixed bug in copying a BTrees.Length instance.
  (https://bugs.launchpad.net/zodb/+bug/516653)

- Fixed bug in cPickleCache's byte size estimation logic.
  (https://bugs.launchpad.net/zodb/+bug/533015)

- Fixed a serious bug that caused cache failures when run
  with Python optimization turned on.

  https://bugs.launchpad.net/zodb/+bug/544305

- When using using a ClientStorage in a Storage server, there was a
  threading bug that caused clients to get disconnected.

- Fixed a bug that caused savepoint rollback to not properly
  set object state when objects implemented _p_invalidate methods
  that reloaded ther state (unghostifiable objects).

  https://bugs.launchpad.net/zodb/+bug/428039

- cross-database wekrefs weren't handled correctly.

  https://bugs.launchpad.net/zodb/+bug/435547

- Fixed some problems in ZEO server commit lock management.

- On Mac OS X, clients that connected and disconnected quickly could
  cause a ZEO server to stop accepting connections, due to a failure
  to catch errors in the initial part of the connection process.

  The failure to properly handle exceptions while accepting
  connections is potentially problematic on other platforms.

  Fixes: https://bugs.launchpad.net/zodb/+bug/135108

3.10.0a1 (2010-02-08)
=====================

New Features
------------

- There are a number of performance enhancements for ZEO storage
  servers.

- FileStorage indexes use a new format. They are saved and loaded much
  faster and take less space. Old indexes can still be read, but new
  indexes won't be readable by older versions of ZODB.

- The API for undoing multiple transactions has changed.  To undo
  multiple transactions in a single transaction, pass a list of
  transaction identifiers to a database's undoMultiple method. Calling a
  database's undo method multiple times in the same transaction now
  raises an exception.

- The ZEO protocol for undo has changed.  The only user-visible
  consequence of this is that when ZODB 3.10 ZEO servers won't support
  undo for older clients.

- The storage API (IStorage) has been tightened. Now, storages should
  raise a StorageTransactionError when invalid transactions are passed
  to tpc_begin, tpc_vote, or tpc_finish.

- ZEO clients (``ClientStorage`` instances) now work in forked processes,
  including those created via ``multiprocessing.Process`` instances.

- Broken objects now provide the IBroken interface.

- As a convenience, you can now pass an integer port as an address to
  the ZEO ClientStorage constructor.

- As a convenience, there's a new ``client`` function in the ZEO
  package for constructing a ClientStorage instance.  It takes the
  same arguments as the ClientStorage constructor.

Bugs Fixed
----------

- Object state management wasn't done correctly when classes
  implemented custom _p_deavtivate methods.
  (https://bugs.launchpad.net/zodb/+bug/185066)

3.9.4 (2009-12-14)
==================

Bugs Fixed
----------

- A ZEO threading bug could cause transactions to read inconsistent
  data.  (This sometimes caused an AssertionError in
  Connection._setstate_noncurrent.)

- DemoStorage.loadBefore sometimes returned invalid data which
  would trigger AssertionErrors in ZODB.Connection.

- History support was broken when using stprages that work with ZODB
  3.8 and 3.9.

- zope.testing was an unnecessary non-testing dependency.

- Internal ZEO errors were logged at the INFO level, rather
  than at the error level.

- The FileStorage backup and restore script, repozo, gave a
  deprecation warning under Python 2.6.

- C Header files weren't installed correctly.

- The undo implementation was incorrect in ways that could cause
  subtle missbehaviors.

3.9.3 (2009-10-23)
==================

Bugs Fixed
----------

- 2 BTree bugs, introduced by a bug fix in 3.9.0c2, sometimes caused
  deletion of keys to be improperly handled, resulting in data being
  available via iteraation but not item access.

3.9.2 (2009-10-13)
==================

Bugs Fixed
----------

- ZEO manages a separate thread for client network IO.  It created
  this thread on import, which caused problems for applications that
  implemented daemon behavior by forking.  Now, the client thread
  isn't created until needed.

- File-storage pack clean-up tasks that can take a long time
  unnecessarily blocked other activity.

- In certain rare situations, ZEO client connections would hang during
  the initial connection setup.

3.9.1 (2009-10-01)
==================

Bugs Fixed
----------

- Conflict errors committing blobs caused ZEO servers to stop committing
  transactions.

3.9.0 (2009-09-08)
==================

New Features (in more or less reverse chronological order)
----------------------------------------------------------

- The Database class now has an ``xrefs`` keyword argument and a
  corresponding allow-implicit-cross-references configuration option.
  which default to true.  When set to false, cross-database references
  are disallowed.

- Added support for RelStorage.

- As a convenience, the connection root method for returning the root
  object can now *also* be used as an object with attributes mapped to
  the root-object keys.

- Databases have a new method, ``transaction``, that can be used with the
  Python (2.5 and later) ``with`` statement::

     db = ZODB.DB(...)
     with db.transaction() as conn:
          # ... do stuff with conn

  This uses a private transaction manager for the connection.
  If control exits the block without an error, the transaction is
  committed, otherwise, it is aborted.

- Convenience functions ZODB.connection and ZEO.connection provide a
  convenient way to open a connection to a database.  They open a
  database and return a connection to it. When the connection is
  closed, the database is closed as well.

- The ZODB.config databaseFrom... methods now support
  multi-databases. If multiple zodb sections are used to define
  multiple databases, the databases are connected in a multi-database
  arrangement and the first of the defined databases is returned.

- The zeopack script has gotten a number of improvements:

  - Simplified command-line interface. (The old interface is still
    supported, except that support for ZEO version 1 servers has been
    dropped.)

  - Multiple storages can be packed in sequence.

    - This simplifies pack scheduling on servers serving multiple
      databases.

    - All storages are packed to the same time.

  - You can now specify a time of day to pack to.

  - The script will now time out if it can't connect to s storage in
    60 seconds.

- The connection now estimates the object size based on its pickle size
  and informs the cache about size changes.

  The database got additional configurations options (`cache-size-bytes`
  and `historical-cache-size-bytes`) to limit the
  cache size based on the estimated total size of cached objects.
  The default values are 0 which has the interpretation "do not limit
  based on the total estimated size".
  There are corresponding methods to read and set the new configuration
  parameters.

- Connections now have a public ``opened`` attribute that is true when
  the connection is open, and false otherwise.  When true, it is the
  seconds since the epoch (time.time()) when the connection was
  opened. This is a renaming of the previous ``_opened`` private
  variable.

- FileStorage now supports blobs directly.

- You can now control whether FileStorages keep .old files when packing.

- POSKeyErrors are no longer logged by ZEO servers, because they are
  really client errors.

- A new storage interface, IExternalGC, to support external garbage
  collection, http://wiki.zope.org/ZODB/ExternalGC, has been defined
  and implemented for FileStorage and ClientStorage.

- As a small convenience (mainly for tests), you can now specify
  initial data as a string argument to the Blob constructor.

- ZEO Servers now provide an option, invalidation-age, that allows
  quick verification of ZEO clients have been disconnected for less
  than a given time even if the number of transactions the client
  hasn't seen exceeds the invalidation queue size. This is only
  recommended if the storage being served supports efficient iteration
  from a point near the end of the transaction history.

- The FileStorage iterator now handles large files better.  When
  iterating from a starting transaction near the end of the file, the
  iterator will scan backward from the end of the file to find the
  starting point.  This enhancement makes it practical to take
  advantage of the new storage server invalidation-age option.

- Previously, database connections were managed as a stack.  This
  tended to cause the same connection(s) to be used over and over.
  For example, the most used connection would typically be the only
  connection used.  In some rare situations, extra connections could
  be opened and end up on the top of the stack, causing extreme memory
  wastage.  Now, when connections are placed on the stack, they sink
  below existing connections that have more active objects.

- There is a new pool-timeout database configuration option to specify that
  connections unused after the given time interval should be garbage
  collection.  This will provide a means of dealing with extra
  connections that are created in rare circumstances and that would
  consume an unreasonable amount of memory.

- The Blob open method now supports a new mode, 'c', to open committed
  data for reading as an ordinary file, rather than as a blob file.
  The ordinary file may be used outside the current transaction and
  even after the blob's database connection has been closed.

- ClientStorage now provides blob cache management. When using
  non-shared blob directories, you can set a target cache size and the
  cache will periodically be reduced try to keep it below the target size.

  The client blob directory layout has changed.  If you have existing
  non-shared blob directories, you will have to remove them.

- ZODB 3.9 ZEO clients can connect to ZODB 3.8 servers.  ZODB ZEO clients
  from ZODB 3.2 on can connect to ZODB 3.9 servers.

- When a ZEO cache is stale and would need verification, a
  ZEO.interfaces.StaleCache event is published (to zope.event).
  Applications may handle this event and take action such as exiting
  the application without verifying the cache or starting cold.

- There's a new convenience function, ZEO.DB, for creating databases
  using ZEO Client Storages.  Just call ZEO.DB with the same arguments
  you would otherwise pass to ZEO.ClientStorage.ClientStorage::

    import ZEO
    db = ZEO.DB(('some_host', 8200))

- Object saves are a little faster

- When configuring storages in a storage server, the storage name now
  defaults to "1".  In the overwhelmingly common case that a single
  storage, the name can now be omitted.

- FileStorage now provides optional garbage collection.  A 'gc'
  keyword option can be passed to the pack method.  A false value
  prevents garbage collection.

- The FileStorage constructor now provides a boolean pack_gc option,
  which defaults to True, to control whether garbage collection is
  performed when packing by default. This can be overridden with the
  gc option to the pack method.

  The ZConfig configuration for FileStorage now includes a pack-gc
  option, corresponding to the pack_gc constructor argument.

- The FileStorage constructor now has a packer keyword argument that
  allows an alternative packer to be supplied.

  The ZConfig configuration for FileStorage now includes a packer
  option, corresponding to the packer constructor argument.

- MappingStorage now supports multi-version concurrency control and
  iteration and provides a better storage implementation example.

- DemoStorage has a number of new features:

  - The ability to use a separate storage, such as a file storage to
    store changes

  - Blob support

  - Multi-version concurrency control and iteration

  - Explicit support for demo-storage stacking via push and pop methods.

- Wen calling ZODB.DB to create a database, you can now pass a file
  name, rather than a storage to use a file storage.

- Added support for copying and recovery of blob storages:

  - Added a helper function, ZODB.blob.is_blob_record for testing whether
    a data record is for a blob.  This can be used when iterating over a
    storage to detect blob records so that blob data can be copied.

    In the future, we may want to build this into a blob-aware
    iteration interface, so that records get blob file attributes
    automatically.

  - Added the IBlobStorageRestoreable interfaces for blob storages
    that support recovery via a restoreBlob method.

  - Updated ZODB.blob.BlobStorage to implement
    IBlobStorageRestoreable and to have a copyTransactionsFrom method
    that also copies blob data.

- New `ClientStorage` configuration option `drop_cache_rather_verify`.
  If this option is true then the ZEO client cache is dropped instead of
  the long (unoptimized) verification. For large caches, setting this
  option can avoid effective down times in the order of hours when
  the connection to the ZEO server was interrupted for a longer time.

- Cleaned-up the storage iteration API and provided an iterator implementation
  for ZEO.

- Versions are no-longer supported.

- Document conflict resolution (see ZODB/ConflictResolution.txt).

- Support multi-database references in conflict resolution.

- Make it possible to examine oid and (in some situations) database
  name of persistent object references during conflict resolution.

- Moved the 'transaction' module out of ZODB.
  ZODB depends upon this module, but it must be installed separately.

- ZODB installation now requires setuptools.

- Added `offset` information to output of `fstail`
  script. Added test harness for this script.

- Added support for read-only, historical connections based
  on datetimes or serials (TIDs).  See
  src/ZODB/historical_connections.txt.

- Removed the ThreadedAsync module.

- Now depend on zc.lockfile

Bugs Fixed
----------

- CVE-2009-2701: Fixed a vulnerability in ZEO storage servers when
  blobs are available. Someone with write access to a ZEO server
  configured to support blobs could read any file on the system
  readable by the server process and remove any file removable by the
  server process.

- BTrees (and TreeSets) kept references to internal keys.
  https://bugs.launchpad.net/zope3/+bug/294788

- BTree Sets and TreeSets don't support the standard set add method.
  (Now either add or the original insert method can be used to add an
  object to a BTree-based set.)

- The runzeo script didn't work without a configuration file.
  (https://bugs.launchpad.net/zodb/+bug/410571)

- Officially deprecated PersistentDict
  (https://bugs.launchpad.net/zodb/+bug/400775)

- Calling __setstate__ on a persistent object could under certain
  uncommon cause the process to crash.
  (https://bugs.launchpad.net/zodb/+bug/262158)

- When committing transactions involving blobs to ClientStorages with
  non-shared blob directories, a failure could occur in tpc_finish if
  there was insufficient disk space to copy the blob file or if the
  file wasn't available.  https://bugs.launchpad.net/zodb/+bug/224169

- Savepoint blob data wasn't properly isolated. If multiple
  simultaneous savepoints in separate transactions modified the same
  blob, data from one savepoint would overwrite data for another.

- Savepoint blob data wasn't cleaned up after a transaction abort.
  https://bugs.launchpad.net/zodb/+bug/323067

- Opening a blob with modes 'r+' or 'a' would fail when the blob had no
  committed changes.

- PersistentList's sort method did not allow passing of keyword parameters.
  Changed its sort parameter list to match that of its (Python 2.4+)
  UserList base class.

- Certain ZEO server errors could cause a client to get into a state
  where it couldn't commit transactions.
  https://bugs.launchpad.net/zodb/+bug/374737

- Fixed vulnerabilities in the ZEO network protocol that allow:

  - CVE-2009-0668 Arbitrary Python code execution in ZODB ZEO storage servers
  - CVE-2009-0669 Authentication bypass in ZODB ZEO storage servers

  The vulnerabilities only apply if you are using ZEO to share a
  database among multiple applications or application instances and if
  untrusted clients are able to connect to your ZEO servers.

- Fixed the setup test command.  It previously depended on private
  functions in zope.testing.testrunner that don't exist any more.

- ZEO client threads were unnamed, making it hard to debug thread
  management.

- ZEO protocol 2 support was broken.  This caused very old clients to
  be unable to use new servers.

- zeopack was less flexible than it was before.  -h should default to
  local host.

- The "lawn" layout was being selected by default if the root of
  the blob directory happened to contain a hidden file or directory
  such as ".svn".  Now hidden files and directories are ignored
  when choosing the default layout.

- BlobStorage was not compatible with MVCC storages because the
  wrappers were being removed by each database connection.  Fixed.

- Saving indexes for large file storages failed (with the error:
  RuntimeError: maximum recursion depth exceeded).  This can cause a
  FileStorage to fail to start because it gets an error trying to save
  its index.

- Sizes of new objects weren't added to the object cache size
  estimation, causing the object-cache size limiting feature to let
  the cache grow too large when many objects were added.

- Deleted records weren't removed when packing file storages.

- Fixed analyze.py and added test.

- fixed Python 2.6 compatibility issue with ZEO/zeoserverlog.py

- using hashlib.sha1 if available in order to avoid DeprecationWarning
  under Python 2.6

- made runzeo -h work

- The monitor server didn't correctly report the actual number of
  clients.

- Packing could return spurious errors due to errors notifying
  disconnected clients of new database size statistics.

- Undo sometimes failed for FileStorages configured to support blobs.

- Starting ClientStorages sometimes failed with non-new but empty
  cache files.

- The history method on ZEO clients failed.

- Fix for bug #251037: Make packing of blob storages non-blocking.

- Fix for bug #220856: Completed implementation of ZEO authentication.

- Fix for bug #184057: Make initialisation of small ZEO client file cache
  sizes not fail.

- Fix for bug #184054: MappingStorage used to raise a KeyError during `load`
  instead of a POSKeyError.

- Fixed bug in Connection.TmpStore: load() would not defer to the backend
  storage for loading blobs.

- Fix for bug #181712: Make ClientStorage update `lastTransaction` directly
  after connecting to a server, even when no cache verification is necessary.

- Fixed bug in blob filesystem helper: the `isSecure` check was inverted.

- Fixed bug in transaction buffer: a tuple was unpacked incorrectly in
  `clear`.

- Bugfix the situation in which comparing persistent objects (for
  instance, as members in BTree set or keys of BTree) might cause data
  inconsistency during conflict resolution.

- Fixed bug 153316: persistent and BTrees were using `int`
  for memory sizes which caused errors on x86_64 Intel Xeon machines
  (using 64-bit Linux).

- Fixed small bug that the Connection.isReadOnly method didn't
  work after a savepoint.

- Bug #98275: Made ZEO cache more tolerant when invalidating current
  versions of objects.

- Fixed a serious bug that could cause client I/O to stop
  (hang). This was accompanied by a critical log message along the
  lines of: "RuntimeError: dictionary changed size during iteration".

- Fixed bug #127182: Blobs were subclassable which was not desired.

- Fixed bug #126007: tpc_abort had untested code path that was
  broken.

- Fixed bug #129921: getSize() function in BlobStorage could not
  deal with garbage files

- Fixed bug in which MVCC would not work for blobs.

- Fixed bug in ClientCache that occurred with objects larger than the total
  cache size.

- When an error occured attempting to lock a file and logging of said error was
  enabled.

- FileStorages previously saved indexes after a certain
  number of writes.  This was done during the last phase of two-phase
  commit, which made this critical phase more subject to errors than
  it should have been.  Also, for large databases, saves were done so
  infrequently as to be useless.  The feature was removed to reduce
  the chance for errors during the last phase of two-phase commit.

- File storages previously kept an internal object id to
  transaction id mapping as an optimization. This mapping caused
  excessive memory usage and failures during the last phase of
  two-phase commit. This optimization has been removed.

- Refactored handling of invalidations on ZEO clients to fix
  a possible ordering problem for invalidation messages.

- On many systems, it was impossible to create more than 32K
  blobs. Added a new blob-directory layout to work around this
  limitation.

- Fixed bug that could lead to memory errors due to the use
  of a Python dictionary for a mapping that can grow large.

- Fixed bug #251037: Made packing of blob storages non-blocking.

- Fixed a bug that could cause InvalidObjectReference errors
  for objects that were explicitly added to a database if the object
  was modified after a savepoint that added the object.

- Fixed several bugs that caused ZEO cache corruption when connecting
  to servers. These bugs affected both persistent and non-persistent caches.

- Improved the the ZEO client shutdown support to try to
  avoid spurious errors on exit, especially for scripts, such as zeopack.

- Packing failed for databases containing cross-database references.

- Cross-database references to databases with empty names
  weren't constructed properly.

- The zeo client cache used an excessive amount of memory, causing applications
  with large caches to exhaust available memory.

- Fixed a number of bugs in the handling of persistent ZEO caches:

  - Cache records are written in several steps.  If a process exits
    after writing begins and before it is finishes, the cache will be
    corrupt on restart.  The way records are written was changed to
    make cache record updates atomic.

  - There was no lock file to prevent opening a cache multiple times
    at once, which would lead to corruption.  Persistent caches now
    use lock files, in the same way that file storages do.

  - A bug in the cache-opening logic led to cache failure in the
    unlikely event that a cache has no free blocks.

- When using ZEO Client Storages, Errors occured when trying to store
  objects too big to fit in the ZEO cache file.

- Fixed bug in blob filesystem helper: the `isSecure` check was inverted.

- Fixed bug in transaction buffer: a tuple was unpacked incorrectly in
  `clear`.

- Fixed bug in Connection.TmpStore: load() would not defer to the
  back-end storage for loading blobs.

- Fixed bug #190884: Wrong reference to `POSKeyError` caused NameError.

- Completed implementation of ZEO authentication. This fixes issue 220856.
