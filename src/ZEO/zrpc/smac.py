"""Sized Message Async Connections.

This class extends the basic asyncore layer with a record-marking
layer.  The message_output() method accepts an arbitrary sized string
as its argument.  It sends over the wire the length of the string
encoded using struct.pack('>I') and the string itself.  The receiver
passes the original string to message_input().

This layer also supports an optional message authentication code
(MAC).  If a session key is present, it uses HMAC-SHA-1 to generate a
20-byte MAC.  If a MAC is present, the high-order bit of the length
is set to 1 and the MAC immediately follows the length.
