# PROTOCOL NEGOTIATION
#
# The code implementing protocol version 2.0.0 (which is deployed
# in the field and cannot be changed) *only* talks to peers that
# send a handshake indicating protocol version 2.0.0.  In that
# version, both the client and the server immediately send out
# their protocol handshake when a connection is established,
# without waiting for their peer, and disconnect when a different
# handshake is receive.
#
# The new protocol uses this to enable new clients to talk to
# 2.0.0 servers.  In the new protocol:
#
#    The server sends its protocol handshake to the client at once.
#
#    The client waits until it receives the server's protocol handshake
#    before sending its own handshake.  The client sends the lower of its
#    own protocol version and the server protocol version, allowing it to
#    talk to servers using later protocol versions (2.0.2 and higher) as
#    well:  the effective protocol used will be the lower of the client
#    and server protocol.  However, this changed in ZODB 3.3.1 (and
#    should have changed in ZODB 3.3) because an older server doesn't
#    support MVCC methods required by 3.3 clients.
#
# [Ugly details:  In order to treat the first received message (protocol
#  handshake) differently than all later messages, both client and server
#  start by patching their message_input() method to refer to their
#  recv_handshake() method instead.  In addition, the client has to arrange
#  to queue (delay) outgoing messages until it receives the server's
#  handshake, so that the first message the client sends to the server is
#  the client's handshake.  This multiply-special treatment of the first
#  message is delicate, and several asyncore and thread subtleties were
#  handled unsafely before ZODB 3.2.6.
# ]
#
# The ZEO modules ClientStorage and ServerStub have backwards
# compatibility code for dealing with the previous version of the
# protocol.  The client accepts the old version of some messages,
# and will not send new messages when talking to an old server.
#
# As long as the client hasn't sent its handshake, it can't send
# anything else; output messages are queued during this time.
# (Output can happen because the connection testing machinery can
# start sending requests before the handshake is received.)
#
# UPGRADING FROM ZEO 2.0.0 TO NEWER VERSIONS:
#
# Because a new client can talk to an old server, but not vice
# versa, all clients should be upgraded before upgrading any
# servers.  Protocol upgrades beyond 2.0.1 will not have this
# restriction, because clients using protocol 2.0.1 or later can
# talk to both older and newer servers.
#
# No compatibility with protocol version 1 is provided.

# Connection is abstract (it must be derived from).  ManagedServerConnection
# and ManagedClientConnection are the concrete subclasses.  They need to
# supply a handshake() method appropriate for their role in protocol
# negotiation.

class Connection(smac.SizedMessageAsyncConnection, object):
    """Dispatcher for RPC on object on both sides of socket.

    The connection supports synchronous calls, which expect a return,
    and asynchronous calls, which do not.

    It uses the Marshaller class to handle encoding and decoding of
    method calls and arguments.  Marshaller uses pickle to encode
    arbitrary Python objects.  The code here doesn't ever see the wire
    format.

    A Connection is designed for use in a multithreaded application,
    where a synchronous call must block until a response is ready.

    A socket connection between a client and a server allows either
    side to invoke methods on the other side.  The processes on each
    end of the socket use a Connection object to manage communication.

    The Connection deals with decoded RPC messages.  They are
    represented as four-tuples containing: msgid, flags, method name,
    and a tuple of method arguments.

    The msgid starts at zero and is incremented by one each time a
    method call message is sent.  Each side of the connection has a
    separate msgid state.

    When one side of the connection (the client) calls a method, it
    sends a message with a new msgid.  The other side (the server),
    replies with a message that has the same msgid, the string
    ".reply" (the global variable REPLY) as the method name, and the
    actual return value in the args position.  Note that each side of
    the Connection can initiate a call, in which case it will be the
    client for that particular call.

    The protocol also supports asynchronous calls.  The client does
    not wait for a return value for an asynchronous call.  The only
    defined flag is ASYNC.  If a method call message has the ASYNC
    flag set, the server will raise an exception.

    If a method call raises an Exception, the exception is propagated
    back to the client via the REPLY message.  The client side will
    raise any exception it receives instead of returning the value to
    the caller.

    #         Added several sever methods:
    #             lastTransaction()
