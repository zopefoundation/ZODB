"""Disk-based client cache for ZEO.

ClientCache exposes an API used by the ZEO client storage.  FileCache stores
objects on disk using a 2-tuple of oid and tid as key.

ClientCache's API is similar to a storage API, with methods like load(),
store(), and invalidate().  It manages in-memory data structures that allow
it to map this richer API onto the simple key-based API of the lower-level
FileCache.

# A disk-based cache for ZEO clients.
# 
# This class provides an interface to a persistent, disk-based cache
# used by ZEO clients to store copies of database records from the
# server.
# 
# The details of the constructor as unspecified at this point.
# 
# Each entry in the cache is valid for a particular range of transaction
# ids.  The lower bound is the transaction that wrote the data.  The
# upper bound is the next transaction that wrote a revision of the
# object.  If the data is current, the upper bound is stored as None;
# the data is considered current until an invalidate() call is made.
# 
# It is an error to call store() twice with the same object without an
# intervening invalidate() to set the upper bound on the first cache
# entry.  Perhaps it will be necessary to have a call the removes
# something from the cache outright, without keeping a non-current
# entry.

# Cache verification
# 
# When the client is connected to the server, it receives
# invalidations every time an object is modified.  When the client is
# disconnected then reconnects, it must perform cache verification to make
# sure its cached data is synchronized with the storage's current state.
# 
# quick verification
# full verification
#


# FileCache stores a cache in a single on-disk file.
#
# On-disk cache structure.
#
# The file begins with a 12-byte header.  The first four bytes are the
# file's magic number - ZEC3 - indicating zeo cache version 4.  The
# next eight bytes are the last transaction id.

magic = "ZEC4"
ZEC_HEADER_SIZE = 12

# After the header, the file contains a contiguous sequence of blocks.  All
# blocks begin with a one-byte status indicator:
#
# 'a'
#       Allocated.  The block holds an object; the next 4 bytes are >I
#       format total block size.
#
# 'f'
#       Free.  The block is free; the next 8 bytes are >Q format total
#       block size.
#
# '1', '2', '3', '4'
#       The block is free, and consists of 1, 2, 3 or 4 bytes total.
#
# "Total" includes the status byte, and size bytes.  There are no
# empty (size 0) blocks.


# Allocated blocks have more structure:
#
#     1 byte allocation status ('a').
#     4 bytes block size, >I format.
#     8 byte oid
#     8 byte start_tid
#     8 byte end_tid
#     4 byte data size
#     data

# The cache's currentofs goes around the file, circularly, forever.
# It's always the starting offset of some block.
#
# When a new object is added to the cache, it's stored beginning at
# currentofs, and currentofs moves just beyond it.  As many contiguous
# blocks needed to make enough room for the new object are evicted,
# starting at currentofs.  Exception:  if currentofs is close enough
# to the end of the file that the new object can't fit in one
# contiguous chunk, currentofs is reset to ZEC_HEADER_SIZE first.
