Zope Enterprize Objects, ZEO 0.2

  Put this package (the ZEO directory, without any wrapping directory
  included in a distribution) in your Zope lib/python.

  Note -- This release of ZEO requires Zope 2.2 or a CVS checkout
    of Zope. See 'CHANGES.txt' for details.

  You also need to symbolically link (or copy) ZServer to lib/python::

    cd lib/python
    ln -s ../../ZServer .

  Finally, you need to link the cPickle extension from your lib/python
  directory into your ZEO directory::

    cd lib/python/ZEO
    ln -s ../cPickle.so .

  This is necessary because ZEO uses a (relatively) new
  cPickle feature that wasn't included in Python 1.5.2.

  To start the storage server, go to your Zope install directory and::

    python lib/python/ZEO/start.py -p port_number

  (Run start without arguments to see options.)

  Of course, the server and the client don't have to be on the same
  machine.

  If the server and client *are* on the same machine, then you can use 
  a Unix domain socket::

    python lib/python/ZEO/start.py -U filename

  To get Zope to use the server, create a custom_zodb module,
  custom_zodb.py, in your Zope install directory, so that Zope uses a
  ClientStorage::

    import ZEO.ClientStorage
    Storage=ZEO.ClientStorage.ClientStorage(('',port_number))

  You can specify a host name (rather than '') if you want.
  The port number is, of course, the port number used to start the 
  storage server.  The async switch tells the client to switch
  itself to async mode (if and) when the asyncore main loop is called.

  You can also give the name of a Unix domain socket file::

    import ZEO.ClientStorage
    Storage=ZEO.ClientStorage.ClientStorage(filename)

  If you want a persistent client cache, you need to define the
  environment variable, ZEO_CLIENT to a unique name for the
  client. This is needed so that unique cache name files can be
  computed. Otherwise, the client cache is stored in temporary files.
  For example, to start two Zope processes with unique caches, use
  something like:

    python z2.py -P8700 ZEO_CLIENT=8700
    python z2.py -P8800 ZEO_CLIENT=8800

  The ClientStorage constructor provides a number of additional
  options (arguments):

    storage -- The name of the storage to connect to.  

    cache_size -- The number of bytes to allow for the client cache.
         The default is 20,000,000.
    
    name -- The name to use for the storage. This will be shown in
         Zope's control panel. The default name is a representation of
         the connection information.

    debug -- If this is provided, it should be a non-empty string. It
         indicates that client should log tracing and debugging
         information, using zLOG.

    var -- The directory in which persistent cache files should be
         written. If this option is provided, it is unnecessary to 
         set INSTANCE_HOME in __builtins__.

  Serving custom storages or multiple storages with the storage server

    The Storage server can host multiple storages and can
    host any kind of storage. Each storage has a unique storage
    name.  By default, the ZEO start.py script serves a 
    standard FileStorage with the name '1'.

    You can control what storages are served by creating a Python
    file containing definitions for the storages and using the '-S'
    option to the start.py script to indicate the storage
    to be served. The form of the -S option is::

       -Sstorage_name=module_path:attribute_name

    Where:

	storage_name -- is the storage name used in the ZEO protocol.
	   This is the name that you give as the optional
	   'storage' keyword argument to the ClientStorage constructor.

	module_path -- This is the path to a Python module
	   that defines the storage object(s) to be served.
	   The module path should ommit the prefix (e.g. '.py').

	attribute_name -- This is the name to which the storage object
	  is assigned in the module.


    Consider the following example. I want to serve a FileStorage
    in read-only mode, which I define in the module file 
    /stores/fs.py::

      import ZODB.FileStorage
      Storage=FileStorage('/stores/fs1.fs', read_only=1)

    I then start start.py with the argument::

      python lib/python/ZEO/start.py -U /xxx/var/zeo.sock \
        -S 1=/stores/fs:Storage

    This option says to serve storage '1'. Storage '1' is
    found in attribute 'Storage' from the module
    '/stores/fs'.

    Now consider a more complicated example. I want to serve the storage
    from the previous example. I also want to serve two Oracle
    storages that are defined in the file '/stores/oracle.py'::

      import DCOracle, DCOracleStorage
      system=DCOracleStorage.DCOracleStorage(
        lambda : DCOracle.Connect('system/manager@spamservice')
        )
      scott=DCOracleStorage.DCOracleStorage(
        lambda : DCOracle.Connect('scott/tiger@spamservice')
        )

    I simply need to include three -S options::

      python lib/python/ZEO/start.py -U /xxx/var/zeo.sock \
        -Ssystem=/stores/oracle:system                 \
        -Sscott=/stores/oracle:scott                   \
        -S1=/stores/fs:Storage

    In this case, we made the storage and attribute name the
    same. To connect to the 'system' or 'scott' storage, we
    need to specify the storage in the ClientStorage constructor, as
    in::

      import ZEO.ClientStorage
      Storage=ZEO.ClientStorage.ClientStorage(
          '/xxx/var/zeo.sock', storage='scott')
   

  Zope product installation

    Normally, Zope updates the Zope database during startup to reflect
    product changes or new products found. It makes no sense for
    multiple ZEO clients to do the same installation. Further, if
    different clients have different software installed, the correct
    state of the database is ambiguous.

    Starting in Zope 2.2, Zope will not modify the Zope database
    during product installation if the environment variable ZEO_CLIENT
    is set. For this reason, Zope must be started without the
    ZEO_CLIENT variable set to install new disk-based products. Of
    course, the disk-based products should be consistent accross ZEO
    Client installations.

  Notes for non Zope users

    First, we regret the amount of dependence on Zope. We intend for
    the dependence to decrease in the long run.

    Known dependencies:

      - Shared must be in the Python path. This is due to a lame
        dependency on some Zope XML facilities used by ZODB for XML
        export and import.

      - ZServer should be in the Python path, or you should copy the
        version of asyncore.py from ZServer (from Zope 2.2 or CVS) to
        your Python path, or you should copy a version of a asyncore
        from the medusa CVS tree to your Python path. A recent change
        in asyncore is required.

      - The module, ThreadedAsync must be in the python path.

      - The version of cPickle from Zope, or from the python.org CVS
        tree must be used. It has a hook to provide control over which
        "global objects" (e.g. classes) may be pickled.
