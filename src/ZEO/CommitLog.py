"""Log a transaction's commit info during two-phase commit.

A storage server allows multiple clients to commit transactions, but
must serialize them as the actually execute at the server.  The
concurrent commits are achieved by logging actions up until the
tpc_vote().  At that point, the entire transaction is committed on the
real storage.
