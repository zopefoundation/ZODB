        """ClientStorage constructor.

        This is typically invoked from a custom_zodb.py file.

        All arguments except addr should be keyword arguments.
        Arguments:

        addr -- The server address(es).  This is either a list of
            addresses or a single address.  Each address can be a
            (hostname, port) tuple to signify a TCP/IP connection or
            a pathname string to signify a Unix domain socket
            connection.  A hostname may be a DNS name or a dotted IP
            address.  Required.

        storage -- The storage name, defaulting to '1'.  The name must
            match one of the storage names supported by the server(s)
            specified by the addr argument.  The storage name is
            displayed in the Zope control panel.

        cache_size -- The disk cache size, defaulting to 20 megabytes.
            This is passed to the ClientCache constructor.

        name -- The storage name, defaulting to ''.  If this is false,
            str(addr) is used as the storage name.

        client -- A name used to construct persistent cache filenames.
            Defaults to None, in which case the cache is not persistent.
            See ClientCache for more info.

        debug -- Ignored.  This is present only for backwards
            compatibility with ZEO 1.

        var -- When client is not None, this specifies the directory
            where the persistent cache files are created.  It defaults
            to None, in whichcase the current directory is used.

        min_disconnect_poll -- The minimum delay in seconds between
            attempts to connect to the server, in seconds.  Defaults
            to 5 seconds.

        max_disconnect_poll -- The maximum delay in seconds between
            attempts to connect to the server, in seconds.  Defaults
            to 300 seconds.

        wait_for_server_on_startup -- A backwards compatible alias for
            the wait argument.

        wait -- A flag indicating whether to wait until a connection
            with a server is made, defaulting to true.

        wait_timeout -- Maximum time to wait for a connection before
            giving up.  Only meaningful if wait is True.

        read_only -- A flag indicating whether this should be a
            read-only storage, defaulting to false (i.e. writing is
            allowed by default).

        read_only_fallback -- A flag indicating whether a read-only
            remote storage should be acceptable as a fallback when no
            writable storages are available.  Defaults to false.  At
            most one of read_only and read_only_fallback should be
            true.

        username -- string with username to be used when authenticating.
            These only need to be provided if you are connecting to an
            authenticated server storage.

        password -- string with plaintext password to be used
            when authenticated.

        realm -- not documented.

        drop_cache_rather_verify -- a flag indicating that the cache
            should be dropped rather than expensively verified.

        blob_dir -- directory path for blob data.  'blob data' is data that
            is retrieved via the loadBlob API.

        shared_blob_dir -- Flag whether the blob_dir is a server-shared
        filesystem that should be used instead of transferring blob data over
        zrpc.

        Note that the authentication protocol is defined by the server
        and is detected by the ClientStorage upon connecting (see
        testConnection() and doAuth() for details).
