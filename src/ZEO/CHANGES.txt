Zope Enterprise Objects (ZEO) Revision History

  ZEO 1.0.0

    Bugs Fixed

      - A forgotten argument made it unreliable to start a ClientStorage
        after the main loop has started.

  ZEO 1.0.0 beta 1

    New Features

      - The server can be made to reopen it's log file
        by sending it a HUP (on systems supporting signals).  Note
        that this requires a change to asyncore to catch interrupted
        system calls on some platforms.

      - The shutdown signals have been changed:

        o To shutdown, use TERM 

        o To restart, use INT.  (This must be send to the 
          child, not the parent.

      - Client scripts can now be written to pack a remote storage and
        wait for the pack results.  This is handy when packing as part
        of cron jobs.

    Bugs Fixed

      - A possible (but unobserved) race condition that could
        lead to ZEO cache corruption was corrected.

      - ZEO clients could fail to start if they needed data that
        wasn't in their cache and if they couldn't talk to a ZEO
        server right away. For now, on startup, the client storage
        will wait to connect to a storage before returning from
        initialization. 

      - Restarting the ZEO server shortly after shutting down could
        lead to "address already in use" errors.

      - User-level eceptions, like undo, version-lock, and conflict
        errors were logged in the server event log.

      - Pack errors weren't logged in the server event log.

      - If an attempt was made to commit a transaction with updates
        while the client storage was disconnected from the server, 
        no further write transactions would be allowed, even after 
	reconnection, and the site would eventually hang.

  Planned for (future) ZEO releases

    New Features

      - Provide optional data compression. This should enhance
        performance over slow connections to the storage server and
        reduce the server I/O load.

      - Provide optional authentication adapters that allow for
        pluggable authentication and encryption schemes.

        This is a feature that is listed on the ZEO fact sheet, but
        that didn't make it into the 1.0 release. Firewall or secure
        tunneling techniques can be used to secure communication
        between clients and the storage for now when the client and
        storage are on different machines. (If they are on the same
        machine, then unix-domain sockets or the loop-back interface
        can be used.)

      - Provide an option to start a client process without waiting
        for a connection to the storage server.  This was the original
        intent, however, it turns out that it can be extremely
        problemantic to get storage errors resulting from attempts to
        read objects not in the cache during process (e.g. Zope)
        startup. In addition, some smarter cache management can be
        done to decrease the probability of important objects being
        removed from the cache.  
 
      - Provide improved client cache management. This will involve
        changes like:

        o Increasing the number of cache files to reduce the number of
          objects lost from the cache (or that need to be recovered)
          when the cache "rolls over".

        o Use separate indexes for each cache.  

        o use better cache indexing structures

  ZEO 0.4.1

    Bugs fixed

      - Improperly handled server exeptions could cause clients to
        lock up.

      - Misshandling of client transaction meta data could cause
        server errors because transaction ids were mangled.

      - The storage server didn't close sockets on shutdown. This
        could sometimes make it necessary to wait before restarting
        the server to avoid "address already in use" messages.

      - The storage server did not log shutdown.

  ZEO 0.4

    Bugs fixed

      - The new (in 0.3) logic to switch to an ordinary user when
        started as root was executed too late so that some files were
        incorrectly owned by root. This caused ZEO clients to fail
        when the cache files were rotated.

      - There were some unusual error conditions that were not handled
        correctly that could cause clients to fail.  This was detected
        only when ZEO was put into production on zope.org.

      - The cache files weren't rotated on reads. This could cause the
        caches to grow way beyond their target sizes.

      - Exceptions raised in the servers asynchronous store handler
        could cause the client and server to get out of sync.

      - Connection and disconnection events weren't logged on the
        server.

    Features added

      - ClientStorage objects have two new constructor arguments,
        min_disconnect_poll and max_disconnect_poll to set the minimum
        and maximum times to wait, in seconds, before retrying to
        reconnect when disconnected from the ZEO server.

      - A call to get database info on startup was eliminated in
        favor of having the server send the information
        automatically. This eliminates a round-trip and, therefore
        speeds up startup a tiny bit.

      - Database size info is now sent to all clients (asynchronously)
        after a pack and after a transaction commit, allowing all
        clients to have timely size information.

      - Added client logging of connection attempts.

      - Added a misc subdirectory with sample storage server start and
        stop scripts and with a sample custom_zodb.py module.

  ZEO 0.3.0

    Bugs fixed

      - Large transactions (e.g. ZCatalog updates) could cause
        spurious conflict errors that could, eventually, make it
        impossible to modify some objects without restarting Zope.

      - Temporary non-persistent cache files were not removed at the
        end of a run.

    Features added

      - On Unix, when the storage server start script is run as root,
        the script will switch to a different user (nobody by
        default). There is a new '-u' option that can be used to
        specify the user.

      - On Unix the server will gracefully close served storages when
        the server is killed with a SIGTERM or SIGHUP. If a
        FileStorage is being served, then an index file will be
        written.

  ZEO 0.2.3

    Bugs fixed

      - Versions didn't work. Not even close. :|
 
      - If a client was disconnected from a server during transaction
        commit, then, when the client was reconnected to the server,
        attempts to commit transactions caused the client to hang.

      - The server would fail (and successfully automatically restart)
        if an unpickleable exception was raised.

  ZEO 0.2.2

    Bugs fixed

      - The storage server didn't fully implement a new ZODB storage
        protocol. This caused serving of FileStorages to fail in Zope
        2.2.1, since FileStorages now use this protocol.

      - In the start.py start script

        o The '-S' option did not allow spaces between the option and it's
          argument.  

        o The '-S' option did not work with FileStorages.

        o The README file didn't mention the '-S' option.

  ZEO 0.2.1

    Bugs fixed

      - ZEO clients didn't work properly (effectively at all) on
        Solaris or Windows NT.

      - An error in the handling of the distributed transaction lock
        could cause a client to stop writing and eventually hang if
        two clients tried to commit a transaction at the same time.

      - Extra (harmless) messages were sent from the server 
        when invalidating objects during a commit.

      - New protocols (especially 'loadSerial'), used for looking at 
        DTML historical versions, were not implemented.

    Features

      - The '-S' option was added to the storage server startup script
        to allow selection of one or more storages to serve.     

  ZEO 0.2 

    This release is expected to be close to beta quality. Initially, the
    primary goals of this release were to:

      - Correct some consistency problems that had been observed in
        0.1 on starup.

      - Allow ZEO clients to detect, survive, and recover from
        disconnection from the ZEO server.

    Based on some feedback from some folks who tried 0.1, improving
    write performance was made a priority.

    Features

      - The ZEO Client now handles server failures gracefully:

        o The client with a persistent cache can generally startup
	  even if the server is not running, assuming that it has at
	  least a minimal number of objects in the cache.

        o The client will continue to function even if the server
          connection is interuppted.

        o Server availability is detected by the client (which tries
          to connect to the server every few minutes). A disconnected
          client will automatically reconnect to an available server.

        o When the client is disconnected, write transactions cannot
          be performed.  Reads fail for objects that are not in the
          cache.

      - Performance enhancements

        The speed of write-intensive operations have been improved
	approximately 70%.  When using Unix domain sockets for
	client/server communication, ZEO transactions take roughly 2-3
	times as long as FileStorage transactions to commit.
	(This was based on some tests. Your mileage may vary.)

      - Packing support was added. Note that packing is done
        asynchrounously. The client returns immediately from a pack
        call. The server packs in a thread and sends updated
        statistics to the client when packing is completed.

      - Support for Unix-domain sockets was added.

      - Pickles sent to the server are now checked to make sure that
        they don't contain unapproved instance or global-variable
        (function) pickles.

    Bugs fixed

      - Data could be badly inconsistent when a persistent cache
        was started, due to a bug in the cache initialization logic.
      
      - The application was allowed to begin operation while the cache
        was being verified. This could lead to harmful inconsistencies.

    Changes made to Zope to support ZEO

      - A number of changes were made to ZODB to support asynchronous
        storage during transaction commit.

      - Normally Zope updates the database during startup to reflect
        product changes. This behavior is now suppressed when the
        ZEO_CLIENT environment variable is set. It doesn't make sense
        for many clients to update the database for the same products.

      - The asyncore module was modified to add support for multiple
        asyncore loops. This change was applied to asyncore in the
        Zope and the (official, owned by Sam Rushing) medusa CVS
        trees.

      - A new module, ThreadedAsync.py has been added in the Zope
        lib/python directory.  This module provides notification to
        async objects (like ZEO clients) to let them know when the
        asyncore main loop has started. This was needed to enable use
        of async code before the main loop starts.

  ZEO 0.1 (aka "iteration 1")

    This was an initial alpha of ZEO that demonstrated basic
    functionalities. It lacked robustness and has some performance
    problems on writes.
