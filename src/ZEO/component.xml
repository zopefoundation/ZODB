    <key name="address" datatype="socket-address"
	 required="yes">
      <description>
	The address at which the server should listen.  This can be in
	the form 'host:port' to signify a TCP/IP connection or a
	pathname string to signify a Unix domain socket connection (at
	least one '/' is required).  A hostname may be a DNS name or a
	dotted IP address.  If the hostname is omitted, the platform's
	default behavior is used when binding the listening socket (''
	is passed to socket.bind() as the hostname portion of the
	address).

    <key name="read-only" datatype="boolean"
	 required="no"
	 default="false">
      <description>
	Flag indicating whether the server should operate in read-only
	mode.  Defaults to false.  Note that even if the server is
	operating in writable mode, individual storages may still be
	read-only.  But if the server is in read-only mode, no write
	operations are allowed, even if the storages are writable.  Note
	that pack() is considered a read-only operation.

    <key name="invalidation-queue-size" datatype="integer"
	 required="no"
	 default="100">
      <description>
	The storage server keeps a queue of the objects modified by the
	last N transactions, where N == invalidation_queue_size.  This
	queue is used to speed client cache verification when a client
	disconnects for a short period of time.
      </description>
    </key>

    <key name="transaction-timeout" datatype="integer"
	 required="no">
      <description>
	The maximum amount of time to wait for a transaction to commit
	after acquiring the storage lock, specified in seconds.  If the
	transaction takes too long, the client connection will be closed
	and the transaction aborted.
