"""Check FileStorage for dangling references.

usage: fsrefs.py [-v] data.fs

fsrefs.py checks object sanity by trying to load the current revision of
every object O in the database, and also verifies that every object
directly reachable from each such O exists in the database.

It's hard to explain exactly what it does because it relies on undocumented
features in Python's cPickle module:  many of the crucial steps of loading
an object are taken, but application objects aren't actually created.  This
saves a lot of time, and allows fsrefs to be run even if the code
implementing the object classes isn't available.

A read-only connection to the specified FileStorage is made, but it is not
recommended to run fsrefs against a live FileStorage.  Because a live
FileStorage is mutating while fsrefs runs, it's not possible for fsrefs to
get a wholly consistent view of the database across the entire time fsrefs
is running; spurious error messages may result.

fsrefs doesn't normally produce any output.  If an object fails to load, the
oid of the object is given in a message saying so, and if -v was specified
then the traceback corresponding to the load failure is also displayed
(this is the only effect of the -v flag).

Three other kinds of errors are also detected, when an object O loads OK,
and directly refers to a persistent object P but there's a problem with P:

 - If P doesn't exist in the database, a message saying so is displayed.
   The unsatisifiable reference to P is often called a "dangling
   reference"; P is called "missing" in the error output.

 - If the current state of the database is such that P's creation has
   been undone, then P can't be loaded either.  This is also a kind of
   dangling reference, but is identified as "object creation was undone".

 - If P can't be loaded (but does exist in the database), a message saying
   that O refers to an object that can't be loaded is displayed.

fsrefs also (indirectly) checks that the .index file is sane, because
fsrefs uses the index to get its idea of what constitutes "all the objects
in the database".

Note these limitations:  because fsrefs only looks at the current revision
of objects, it does not attempt to load objects in versions, or non-current
revisions of objects; therefore fsrefs cannot find problems in versions or
in non-current revisions.
