Feature requests
================

Feature requests are currently handled a bit ad-hoc. Feel free to write a post
to the mailing list asking for a feature and - if you don't want it to be
forgotten - add a
`blueprint in Launchpad <http://blueprints.launchpad.net/zodb>`_

Also, formerly we used to manage proposals in our old wiki at
http://wiki.zope.org/ZODB/ListOfProposals/contents#ListOfProposals
