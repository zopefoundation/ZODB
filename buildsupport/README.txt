zpkg support files
==================

Files and packages included here are intended to support the use of
zpkg as a build tool.  They are not part of Zope, are not included in
the distribution, and are not importable in the application server.

The setup.py script will process any .pth files placed here, though
those would not normally be handled by most applications.
