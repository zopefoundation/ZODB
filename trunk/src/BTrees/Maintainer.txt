This document provides information for developers who maintain or
extend BTrees.

Macros
======
BTrees are defined using a "template", roughly akin to a a C++
template.  To create a new family of BTrees, create a source file that
defines macros used to handle differences in key and value types:


Configuration Macros

MASTER_ID
A string to hold an RCS/CVS Id key to be included in compiled binaries.

MOD_NAME_PREFIX
A string (like "IO" or "OO") that provides the prefix used for the
module.  This gets used to generate type names and the internal module
name string.

DEFAULT_MAX_BUCKET_SIZE
An int giving the maximum bucket size (number of key/value pairs).
When a bucket gets larger than this due to an insertion *into a BTREE*,
it splits.  Inserting into a bucket directly doesn't split, and
functions that produce a bucket output (e.g., union()) also have no
bound on how large a bucket may get.  Someday this will be tunable
on BTree instances.

DEFAULT_MAX_BTREE_SIZE
An int giving the maximum size (number of children) of an internal
btree node.  Someday this will be tunable on BTree instances.


Macros for Keys

KEY_TYPE
The C type declaration for keys (e.g., int or PyObject*).

KEY_CHECK(K)
Tests whether the PyObject* K can be converted to the (C) key type
(KEY_TYPE).  The macro should return a boolean (zero for false,
non-zero for true).  When it returns false, its caller should probably
set a TypeError exception.

TEST_KEY(K, T)
Like Python's cmp().  Compares K(ey) to T(arget), where K & T are C
data values of type KEY_TYPE).  Return an int
   < 0 if K < T
  == 0 if K == T
   > 0 if K > T

DECREF_KEY(K)
K is a value of KEY_TYPE.  If KEY_TYPE is a flavor of PyObject*, write
this to do Py_DECREF(K).  Else (e.g., KEY_TYPE is int) make it a nop.

INCREF_KEY(K)
K is a value of KEY_TYPE.  If KEY_TYPE is a flavor of PyObject*, write
this to do Py_INCREF(K).  Else (e.g., KEY_TYPE is int) make it a nop.

COPY_KEY(K, E)
Like K=E.  Copy a key from E to K, both of KEY_TYPE.  Note that this
doesn't decref K or incref E when KEY_TYPE is a PyObject*; the caller
is responsible for keeping refcounts straight.

COPY_KEY_TO_OBJECT(O, K)
Roughly like O=K.  O is a PyObject*, and the macro must build a Python
object form of K, assign it to O, and ensure that O owns the reference
to its new value.  It may do this by creating a new Python object based
on K (e.g., PyInt_FromLong(K) when KEY_TYPE is int), or simply by doing
Py_INCREF(K) if KEY_TYPE is a PyObject*.

COPY_KEY_FROM_ARG(TARGET, ARG, STATUS)
Copy an argument to the target without creating a new reference to ARG.
ARG is a PyObject*, and TARGET is of type KEY_TYPE.  If this can't be
done (for example, KEY_CHECK(ARG) returns false), set a Python error
and set status to 0.  If there is no error, leave status alone.


Macros for Values

VALUE_TYPE
The C type declaration for values (e.g., int or PyObject*).

TEST_VALUE(K, T)
Like TEST_KEY, except applied to values of VALUE_TYPE.

DECREF_VALUE(K)
Like DECREF_KEY, except applied to values of VALUE_TYPE.

INCREF_VALUE(K)
Like INCREF_KEY, except applied to values of VALUE_TYPE.

COPY_VALUE(K, E)
Like COPY_KEY, except applied to values of VALUE_TYPE.

COPY_VALUE_TO_OBJECT(O, K)
Like COPY_KEY_TO_OBJECT, except applied to values of VALUE_TYPE.

COPY_VALUE_FROM_ARG(TARGET, ARG, STATUS)
Like COPY_KEY_FROM_ARG, except applied to values of VALUE_TYPE.

NORMALIZE_VALUE(V, MIN)
Normalize the value, V, using the parameter MIN.  This is almost
certainly a YAGNI.  It is a no op for most types. For integers, V is
replaced by V/MIN only if MIN > 0.


Macros for Set Operations

MERGE_DEFAULT
A value of VALUE_TYPE specifying the value to associate with set
elements when sets are merged with mappings via weighed union or
weighted intersection.

MERGE(O1, w1, O2, w2)
Performs a weighted merge of two values, O1 and O2, using weights w1
and w2.  The result must be of VALUE_TYPE.  Note that weighted unions
and weighted intersections are not enabled if this macro is left
undefined.

MERGE_WEIGHT(O, w)
Computes a weighted value for O.  The result must be of VALUE_TYPE.
This is used for "filling out" weighted unions, i.e. to compute a
weighted value for keys that appear in only one of the input
mappings.  If left undefined, MERGE_WEIGHT defaults to

    #define MERGE_WEIGHT(O, w) (O)

MULTI_INT_UNION
The value doesn't matter.  If defined, SetOpTemplate.c compiles
code for a multiunion() function (compute a union of many input sets
at high speed).  This currently makes sense only for II sets, so
only _IIBTree.c defines it.
