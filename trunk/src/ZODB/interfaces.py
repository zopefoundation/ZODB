class IConnection(Interface):
    """Connection to ZODB for loading and storing objects.

    The Connection object serves as a data manager.  The root() method
    on a Connection returns the root object for the database.  This
    object and all objects reachable from it are associated with the
    Connection that loaded them.  When a transaction commits, it uses
    the Connection to store modified objects.

    Typical use of ZODB is for each thread to have its own
    Connection and that no thread should have more than one Connection
    to the same database.  A thread is associated with a Connection by
    loading objects from that Connection.  Objects loaded by one
    thread should not be used by another thread.

    A Connection can be associated with a single version when it is
    created.  By default, a Connection is not associated with a
    version; it uses non-version data.

    Each Connection provides an isolated, consistent view of the
    database, by managing independent copies of objects in the
    database.  At transaction boundaries, these copies are updated to
    reflect the current state of the database.

    You should not instantiate this class directly; instead call the
    open() method of a DB instance.

    In many applications, root() is the only method of the Connection
    that you will need to use.

    Synchronization
    ---------------

    A Connection instance is not thread-safe.  It is designed to
    support a thread model where each thread has its own transaction.
    If an application has more than one thread that uses the
    connection or the transaction the connection is registered with,
    the application should provide locking.

    The Connection manages movement of objects in and out of object
    storage.

    TODO:  We should document an intended API for using a Connection via
    multiple threads.

    TODO:  We should explain that the Connection has a cache and that
    multiple calls to get() will return a reference to the same
    object, provided that one of the earlier objects is still
    referenced.  Object identity is preserved within a connection, but
    not across connections.

    TODO:  Mention the database pool.

    A database connection always presents a consistent view of the
    objects in the database, although it may not always present the
    most current revision of any particular object.  Modifications
    made by concurrent transactions are not visible until the next
    transaction boundary (abort or commit).

    Two options affect consistency.  By default, the mvcc and synch
    options are enabled by default.

    If you pass mvcc=False to db.open(), the Connection will never read
    non-current revisions of an object.  Instead it will raise a
    ReadConflictError to indicate that the current revision is
    unavailable because it was written after the current transaction
    began.

    The logic for handling modifications assumes that the thread that
    opened a Connection (called db.open()) is the thread that will use
    the Connection.  If this is not true, you should pass synch=False
    to db.open().  When the synch option is disabled, some transaction
    boundaries will be missed by the Connection; in particular, if a
    transaction does not involve any modifications to objects loaded
    from the Connection and synch is disabled, the Connection will
    miss the transaction boundary.  Two examples of this behavior are
    db.undo() and read-only transactions.

        User Methods:
            root, get, add, close, db, sync, isReadOnly, cacheGC, cacheFullSweep,

        A persistent object is normally added to the database and
        assigned an oid when it becomes reachable to an object already in
        the database.  In some cases, it is useful to create a new
        object and use its oid (_p_oid) in a single transaction.

        This method assigns a new oid regardless of whether the object
        is reachable.

        The object is added when the transaction commits.  The object
        must implement the IPersistent interface and must not
        already be associated with a Connection.

        Application code should call undoLog() on a DB instance instead of on
        the storage directly.

        A transaction description is a mapping with at least these keys:

            "time":  The time, as float seconds since the epoch, when
                     the transaction committed.
            "user_name":  The value of the `.user` attribute on that
                          transaction.
            "description":  The value of the `.description` attribute on
                            that transaction.
            "id`"  A string uniquely identifying the transaction to the
                   storage.  If it's desired to undo this transaction,
                   this is the `transaction_id` to pass to `undo()`.

        In addition, if any name+value pairs were added to the transaction
        by `setExtendedInfo()`, those may be added to the transaction
        description mapping too (for example, FileStorage's `undoLog()` does
        this).

        `filter` is a callable, taking one argument.  A transaction
        description mapping is passed to `filter` for each potentially
        undoable transaction.  The sequence returned by `undoLog()` excludes
        descriptions for which `filter` returns a false value.  By default,
        `filter` always returns a true value.

        ZEO note:  Arbitrary callables cannot be passed from a ZEO client
        to a ZEO server, and a ZEO client's implementation of `undoLog()`
        ignores any `filter` argument that may be passed.  ZEO clients
        should use the related `undoInfo()` method instead (if they want
        to do filtering).

        Now picture a list containing descriptions of all undoable
        transactions that pass the filter, most recent transaction first (at
        index 0).  The `first` and `last` arguments specify the slice of this
        (conceptual) list to be returned:

            `first`:  This is the index of the first transaction description
                      in the slice.  It must be >= 0.
            `last`:  If >= 0, first:last acts like a Python slice, selecting
                     the descriptions at indices `first`, first+1, ..., up to
                     but not including index `last`.  At most last-first
                     descriptions are in the slice, and `last` should be at
                     least as large as `first` in this case.  If `last` is
                     less than 0, then abs(last) is taken to be the maximum
                     number of descriptions in the slice (which still begins
                     at index `first`).  When `last` < 0, the same effect
                     could be gotten by passing the positive first-last for
                     `last` instead.

        """Return a sequence of descriptions for undoable transactions.

        This is like `undoLog()`, except for the `specification` argument.
        If given, `specification` is a dictionary, and `undoInfo()`
