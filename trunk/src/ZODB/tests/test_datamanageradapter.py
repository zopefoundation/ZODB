    So, we have a data manager:

    >>> dm = DataManager()

    and we do some work that modifies uncommited state:

    >>> dm.inc()
    >>> dm.state, dm.delta
    (0, 1)

    Now we'll commit the changes.  When the data manager joins a transaction,
    the transaction will create an adapter.

    >>> dma = DataManagerAdapter(dm)

    and register it as a modified object. At commit time, the
    transaction will get the "jar" like this:

    >>> jar = getattr(dma, '_p_jar', dma)

    and, of course, the jar and the adapter will be the same:

    >>> jar is dma
    True

    The transaction will call tpc_begin:

    >>> t1 = '1'
    >>> jar.tpc_begin(t1)

    Then the transaction will call commit on the jar:

    >>> jar.commit(t1)

    This doesn't actually do anything. :)

    >>> dm.state, dm.delta
    (0, 1)

    The transaction will then call tpc_vote:

    >>> jar.tpc_vote(t1)

    This prepares the data manager:

    >>> dm.state, dm.delta
    (1, 1)
    >>> dm.prepared
    True

    Finally, tpc_finish is called:

    >>> jar.tpc_finish(t1)

    and the data manager finishes the two-phase commit:

    >>> dm.state, dm.delta
    (1, 0)
    >>> dm.prepared
