Removal of Features Deprecated in ZODB 3.4
------------------------------------------

(3.6b2) ZODB 3.6 no longer contains features officially deprecated in the
ZODB 3.4 release.  These include:

- ``get_transaction()``.  Use ``transaction.get()`` instead.
  ``transaction.commit()`` is a shortcut spelling of
  ``transaction.get().commit()``, and ``transaction.abort()``
  of ``transaction.get().abort()``.  Note that importing ZODB no longer
  installs ``get_transaction`` as a name in Python's ``__builtin__``
  module either.

- The ``begin()`` method of ``Transaction`` objects.  Use the ``begin()``
  method of a transaction manager instead.  ``transaction.begin()`` is
  a shortcut spelling to call the default transaction manager's ``begin()``
  method.

- The ``dt`` argument to ``Connection.cacheMinimize()``.

- The ``Connection.cacheFullSweep()`` method.  Use ``cacheMinimize()``
  instead.

- The ``Connection.getTransaction()`` method.  Pass a transaction manager
  to ``DB.open()`` instead.

- The ``Connection.getLocalTransaction()`` method.  Pass a transaction
  manager to ``DB.open()`` instead.

- The ``cache_deactivate_after`` and ``version_cache_deactivate_after``
  arguments to the ``DB`` constructor.

- The ``temporary``, ``force``, and ``waitflag`` arguments
  to ``DB.open()``.  ``DB.open()`` no longer blocks (there's no longer
  a fixed limit on the number of open connections).

- The ``transaction`` and ``txn_mgr``arguments to ``DB.open()``.  Use
  the ``transaction_manager`` argument instead.

- The ``getCacheDeactivateAfter``, ``setCacheDeactivateAfter``,
  ``getVersionCacheDeactivateAfter`` and ``setVersionCacheDeactivateAfter``
  methods of ``DB``.

Persistent
----------

- (3.6.1) Suppressed warnings about signedness of characters when
  compiling under GCC 4.0.x.  See http://www.zope.org/Collectors/Zope/2027.

- (3.6a4) ZODB 3.6 introduces a change to the basic behavior of Persistent
  objects in a particular end case.  Before ZODB 3.6, setting
  ``obj._p_changed`` to a true value when ``obj`` was a ghost was ignored:
  ``obj`` remained a ghost, and getting ``obj._p_changed`` continued to
  return ``None``.  Starting with ZODB 3.6, ``obj`` is activated instead
  (unghostified), and its state is changed from the ghost state to the
  changed state.  The new behavior is less surprising and more robust.

- (3.6b5) The documentation for ``_p_oid`` now specifies the concrete
  type of oids (in short, an oid is either None or a non-empty string).

Commit hooks
------------

- (3.6a1) The ``beforeCommitHook()`` method has been replaced by the new
  ``addBeforeCommitHook()`` method, with a more-robust signature.
  ``beforeCommitHook()`` is now deprecated, and will be removed in ZODB 3.8.
  Thanks to Julien Anguenot for contributing code and tests.

Connection management
---------------------

- (3.6b6) When more than ``pool_size`` connections have been closed,
  ``DB`` forgets the excess (over ``pool_size``) connections closed first.
  Python's cyclic garbage collection can take "a long time" to reclaim them
  (and may in fact never reclaim them if application code keeps strong
  references to them), but such forgotten connections can never be opened
  again, so their caches are now cleared at the time ``DB`` forgets them.
  Most applications won't notice a difference, but applications that open
  many connections, and/or store many large objects in connection caches,
  and/or store limited resources (such as RDB connections) in connection
  caches may benefit.

- Changed the automatic garbage collection when opening a connection to only
  apply the garbage collections on those connections in the pool that are
  closed. (This fixed issue 113932.)

ZEO
---

- (3.6a4) Collector 1900.  In some cases of pickle exceptions raised by
  low-level ZEO communication code, callers of ``marshal.encode()`` could
  attempt to catch an exception that didn't actually exist, leading to an
  erroneous ``AttributeError`` exception.  Thanks to Tres Seaver for the
  diagnosis.

BaseStorage
-----------

- (3.6a4) Nothing done by ``tpc_abort()`` should raise an exception.
  However, if something does (an error case), ``BaseStorage.tpc_abort()``
  left the commit lock in the acquired state, causing any later attempt
  to commit changes hang.

Multidatabase
-------------

- (3.6b1) The ``database_name`` for a database in a multidatabase
  collection can now be specified in a config file's ``<zodb>`` section,
  as the value of the optional new ``database_name`` key.  The
  ``.databases`` attribute cannot be specified in a config file, but
  can be passed as the optional new ``databases`` argument to the
  ``open()`` method of a ZConfig factory for type ``ZODBDatabase``.
  For backward compatibility, Zope 2.9 continues to allow using the
  name in its ``<zodb_db name>`` config section as the database name
  (note that ``<zodb_db>`` is defined by Zope, not by ZODB -- it's a
  Zope-specific extension of ZODB's ``<zodb>`` section).

PersistentMapping
-----------------

- (3.6.1) PersistentMapping was inadvertently pickling volatile attributes
  (http://www.zope.org/Collectors/Zope/2052).

- (3.6b4) ``PersistentMapping`` makes changes by a ``pop()`` method call
  persistent now (http://www.zope.org/Collectors/Zope/2036).

- (3.6a1) The ``PersistentMapping`` class has an ``__iter__()`` method
  now, so that objects of this type work well with Python's iteration
  protocol.  For example, if ``x`` is a ``PersistentMapping`` (or
  Python dictionary, or BTree, or ``PersistentDict``, ...), then
  ``for key in x:`` iterates over the keys of ``x``, ``list(x)`` creates
  a list containing ``x``'s keys, ``iter(x)`` creates an iterator for
  ``x``'s keys, and so on.

Tools
-----
- (3.6.3) Fixed bug in 'fsrefs.py' which caused it to report erroneous
  "missing" classes.

- (3.6b5) The changeover from zLOG to the logging module means that some
  tools need to perform minimal logging configuration themselves. Changed
  the zeoup script to do so and thus enable it to emit error messages.

BTrees
------

- (3.6.1) Suppressed warnings about signedness of characters when
  compiling under GCC 4.0.x.  See http://www.zope.org/Collectors/Zope/2027.

- (3.6a1) BTrees and Buckets now implement the ``setdefault()`` and ``pop()``
  methods. These are exactly like Python's dictionary methods of the same
  names, except that ``setdefault()`` requires both arguments (and Python is
  likely to change to require both arguments too -- defaulting the
  ``default`` argument to ``None`` has no viable use cases).  Thanks to
  Ruslan Spivak for contributing code, tests, and documentation.

- (3.6a1) Collector 1873.  It wasn't possible to construct a BTree or Bucket
  from, or apply their update() methods to, a PersistentMapping or
  PersistentDict.  This works now.

ZopeUndo
--------

- (3.6a4) Collector 1810. A previous bugfix (#1726) broke listing undoable
  transactions for users defined in a non-root acl_users folder. Zope logs
  a acl_users path together with a username (separated by a space) and this
  previous fix failed to take this into account.

Connection
----------

- (3.6b5) An optimization for loading non-current data (MVCC) was
  inadvertently disabled in ``_setstate()``; this has been repaired.

Documentation
-------------

- (3.6b3) Thanks to Stephan Richter for converting many of the doctest
  files to ReST format.  These are now chapters in the Zope 3 apidoc too.

- (3.6b4) Several misspellings of "occurred" were repaired.

Development
-----------

- (3.6a1) The source code for the old ExtensionClass-based Persistence
  package moved, from ZODB to the Zope 2.9 development tree.  ZODB 3.5
  makes no use of Persistence, and, indeed, the Persistence package could
  not be compiled from a ZODB release, since some of the C header files
  needed appear only in Zope.

- (3.6a3) Re-added the ``zeoctl`` module, for the same reasons
  ``mkzeoinst`` was re-added (see below).

- (3.6a2) The ``mkzeoinst`` module was re-added to ZEO, because Zope3
  has a script that expects to import it from there.  ZODB's ``mkzeoinst``
  script was rewritten to invoke the ``mkzeoinst`` module.

``transact``
------------

- (3.6b4) Collector 1959:  The undocumented ``transact`` module no
  longer worked.  It remains undocumented and untested, but thanks to
  Janko Hauser it's possible that it works again ;-).
