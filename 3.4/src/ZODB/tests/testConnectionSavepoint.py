We ran into a problem in which abort failed after adding an object in
a savepoint and then modifying the object.  The problem was that, on
commit, the savepoint was aborted before the modifications were
aborted.  Because the object was added in the savepoint, its _p_oid
and _p_jar were cleared when the savepoint was aborted.  The object
was in the registered-object list.  There's an invariant for this
list that states that all objects in the list should have an oid and
(correct) jar.

The fix was to abort work done after the savepoint before aborting the
savepoint.

def testModifyThenSavePointThenModifySomeMoreThenCommit():

We got conflict errors when we committed after we modified an object
in a savepoint, and then modified it some more after the last
savepoint.

The problem was that we were effectively commiting the object twice --
when commiting the current data and when committing the savepoint.
The fix was to first make a new savepoint to move new changes to the
savepoint storage and *then* to commit the savepoint storage. (This is
similar to the strategy that was used for subtransactions prior to
savepoints.)
