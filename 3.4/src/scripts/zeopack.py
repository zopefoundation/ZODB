"""Connect to a ZEO server and ask it to pack.

Usage: zeopack.py [options]

Options:

    -p port -- port to connect to

    -h host -- host to connect to (default is current host)

    -U path -- Unix-domain socket to connect to

    -S name -- storage name (default is '1')

    -d days -- pack objects more than days old

    -1 -- Connect to a ZEO 1 server

    -W -- wait for server to come up.  Normally the script tries to
       connect for 10 seconds, then exits with an error.  The -W
       option is only supported with ZEO 1.

You must specify either -p and -h or -U.
