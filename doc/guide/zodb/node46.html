<H2><A NAME="SECTION000850000000000000000">
B..4 Modifications</A>
</H2>

<P>
You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release
the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy
of it.  In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
   from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions
   (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section
   of the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version
   if the original publisher of that version gives permission.
</LI>
<LI>List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
   responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified
   Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the
   Document (all of its principal authors, if it has less than five).
</LI>
<LI>State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
   Modified Version, as the publisher.
</LI>
<LI>Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.
</LI>
<LI>Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
   adjacent to the other copyright notices.
</LI>
<LI>Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
   giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the
   terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.
</LI>
<LI>Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections
   and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.
</LI>
<LI>Include an unaltered copy of this License.
</LI>
<LI>Preserve the section entitled ``History'', and its title, and add to
   it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and
   publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If
   there is no section entitled ``History'' in the Document, create one
   stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as
   given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
   Version as stated in the previous sentence.
</LI>
<LI>Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
   public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise
   the network locations given in the Document for previous versions
   it was based on.  These may be placed in the ``History'' section.
   You may omit a network location for a work that was published at
   least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
   publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.
</LI>
<LI>In any section entitled ``Acknowledgements'' or ``Dedications'',
   preserve the section's title, and preserve in the section all the
   substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements
   and/or dedications given therein.
</LI>
<LI>Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
   unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
   or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.
</LI>
<LI>Delete any section entitled ``Endorsements''.  Such a section
   may not be included in the Modified Version.
</LI>
<LI>Do not retitle any existing section as ``Endorsements''
   or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.

<P>
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all
of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the
list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice.
These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.

<P>
You may add a section entitled ``Endorsements'', provided it contains
nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
parties - for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
standard.

<P>
You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list
of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of
Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already
includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or
by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,
you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.

<P>
The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

<P>
